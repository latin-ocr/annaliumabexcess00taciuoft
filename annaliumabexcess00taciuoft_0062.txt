42. Some passive uses are more or less peculiar. Dr. § 26. l
(a) ne poetical personal passive qs intransitive verbs, as triumphari 12.?
19, 3; regnari 13. 54, 2 3 dubitari 14. 7, 1. “
N(b) Coepi is used sreehz not only wz'tlz passives having a middle force (asj
fieri, haberi, duci, augeri, moveri), but without such restriction, as 1. 34, 2 ςζ
’ 4. 63, 1, etc. (so Livy and Curtius) 3 so also desino, as 1. 13, 6. Tacitus}
also uses coeptus actively, as in 1. 65, 3, etc.‚ and never uses the passive
form coeptus sum.

(c) Some rare or poetz'cal passive uses os deponent participle forms, as}r
ausus 3. 67, 4 (ἅπ. εἷρ.); the substantival ausum 2. 39, 3, etc. ς and inausum}
1. 42, 3 ; and the adjective inexpertus 1. 59, 7, etc. ’

43. 'l'he simple infinitive (inf. of direct object, Roby 1344) is often³L
used by Tacitus, as by other prose writers of that age and earlier poets‚ with
verbs not usually taking this construction in classical prose; such as ’
those which contain a complete idea in themselves, or which figuratively
denote an inclination or effort (Madv. 389, Obs. 2), or such as denote an '
influence over others and take an accus. or dat. (Id. 390, Obs. 4. 5. 6).ῑ
Dr. (ξ 145) gives a list of more than fifty such words so used by Tacitus„
of which the great maj0rity are restricted to the Annals. In respect of
the following, the usage is altogether confined to him: aemulor H. 2. 62,
4 (ἅπ. εῖρ.); ambio Ann. 2. 43, 3 ; amplector H. 3. 84, 3; compono Ann.
3. 40, 3 (ἅπ. εἷρ.); induco 12. 9, 1 (ἅπ. εἶρ.); inlicio 2. 37, 23 4. 12, 7;
nuntio (to command by messenger) 16. 11, 1 (ἅπ. εῖρ.) ; perpello 6. 33, 1, ’
etc. ; scribo (to command by letter) 12. 29, 2 ς 15. 25, 6. Several others
appear to be so used in no earlier prose author.

44. 'I'he accusative with infinitivo (inf.‚ as oblique predicate, Roby
1 351) is used, with considerably more freedom than that of earlier writers,
with verbs more or less analogous to those falling under the usual rules
(see Madv. 394, etc.‚ Roby 1. l.). Peculiar to Tacitus is the extension of
this construction to adnectere 4. 28, 23 dedignari 12. 37, 1; illacrymare
2. 71, 4; impetrare 12. 27, 13 urgere 11. 26, 1 ς also to some verbs of.
accusing, as accusare 14. 18, 1; incusare 3. 38, 4 (all ἅπ. εἰρ.). Os the
whole list of more than twenty given by Dr. (ξ 146) by far the larger number
are from the Annals. Tacitus follows Livy in extending this construction
to negative expressions of doubt, as 2. 26, 23 36, 2; 43, 4; 3. 29, 2 ; 4.
70, 7, etc.‚ with which it is used only once by Cicero (ad Fam. 16. 21, 2), ¹
