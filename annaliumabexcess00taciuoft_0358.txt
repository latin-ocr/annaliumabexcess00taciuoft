abnuisset.

Several instances are here collected by
Nipp.‚ in most of which there are special
reasons >making the singular ‘nemo ’ less
appropriate.

2.- epistulis, used osa single letter, as
in 1. 30, 4, etc.

3. luxus et superbiae. The evidence
alleged for the former charge is to be

inferred from c. 57, 5. The latter may.

be supposed to have consisted in contemp-
tuous treatment of Piso himself.

seque pulsum, sc. ‘dicit,’ latent in
‘ incusat? This part of the charge seems
levelled, not at Germanicus, but at Sentius,
whose appointment he treats as the un-
constitutional act of a knot of private
conspirators. Hence the allusion to ⁶ res
novae‚’ to shift a charge made against
himself (cp. 3. 13, 3).

5. litorum oram. Either word might
have sufficed alone, but the combination
may ,haxve begu suggested by ‘litoris
oram er . . 2, .

6. laio mgri. ‘ Astigi ‘ has been adopted,
from Lips., by several edd. (including
Nipp.), but ‘ lato ’ may be explained by its
connexion with ‘praeter insulas.’ Several
islands lay in his course from Cos to
Rhodes; and he was to pass outside
these, probably also south of Rhodes and
Cyprus, or at least not to take the usual
course along the coast of Lycia and
Pamphylia. He would thus avoid the
chance of collision with Agrippina (cp. c.
79, 1), and reach Syria before his move-
ments were known.

desertores, i.e. from the Syrian le-
glons.

8. vexillum. On the use of this and
its cognate words of any kind of legionary
detached force, see on 1. 38, 1, etc.
These are a body of recruits to be drafted
into the Syrian legions.

9. Cilicum, i-e. those of Trachea (see
6. 41, 1), and Olbe (Marquardt, Staatsv. i.
p. 227). A third principality had lately
come to an end (cp. c. 42, 7). His action
here and in c. 80 shows that Cilicia be-
longed at this time to Syria. See Mar-
quardt, Staatsv. i. p. 229.

1 2. praelegentes, ‘ coasting along ; ’ a
Tacitean sense of the word: cp. 6. 1, 1,
and similar uses of ⁶ prae ' in composition
noted on c. 6, 5.

in the MS. ‘uibimus,' but is bracketed by
Ritt. Tacitus usually repeats one name
only of a person recently mentioned, but
Nipp. shows several exceptions to this
mle, such as the repetitions ‘Junio Otho-
ni ’ 3. 66, 43 ‘C. Silani ' 3. 69,-1; ‘ Lar-
gus Caecina’ 11. 34, 2, etc.

nuntiavit. The proper word would
be ‘denuntiavit3‘ but ‘nuntiare' has in '
Tacitus t'he meaning of ‘to command by

5. 5, 1; 6. 46, 9, ete. The sense of the ,ν
word found in 3. 67, Ἰ, etc„ seems less ,ζ’
suitable here. i
