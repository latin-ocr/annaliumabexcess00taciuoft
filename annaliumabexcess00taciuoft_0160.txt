1. A (1). Tm: family history of the Octavii, with further account of the
father and mother of Augustus, is given by Suetonius (Aug. 1-4). The:
distinctions of his father are enumerated in an inscription (Orell. 592),
which states that he was twice trib. mil„ also quaestor, plebeian aedile,
iudex quaestionum, praetor, and proconsul of Macedonia, where he

became entitled to the name of imperator. The date of his praetorship⁴
. was 693, ac. 613 and he was prevented from becoming a candidate⁴
for the consulship in 696, 13.c. 58, by his death at the very beginning}
of that, or at the end of the previous year. ³

2. A (3). The frequency of betrothal, and even nominal marriage, during .
· mere childhood, among Romans at this time (see Friedlaender, Sitteng.⁴
i. p. 504, foll.), makes it possible to reconcile some such a date as that ς
given for Octavia's birth with her betrothal or marriage to C. Marcellus
in 700, 13.c. 54; in which year it was also contemplated to give her in:
marriage to Cn. Pompeius (Suet. Jul. 27). Marcellus, who was a leading .
opponent of Julius Caesar, but subsequently reconciled to him, had just
died when Octavia, with contempt for all usual decorum (see Dio, 488
31, 3), was hastily married to M. Antonius in 713⁴, 13.c. 41, by one οΓΞ
the articles of·the compact at Brundusium. On the honours paid to her ⁴
at her death, see Dio, 54. 35, 4.

3. Α (4). Octavius assumed the name of C. Julius Caesar Octavianus in]
consequence of his adoption by the dictator’s will: hence Cicero styles:
him ‘. C. Caesar’ in official language (Phil. 5, c. 16—19), and sometimes j
in priVate letters ‘Octavianus' (ad Att. 16. 18, 13 11, 6, etc.). On the}
subsequent history of his names and titles, see vi. p. 63, etc. He had}
been first betrothed to a daughter of P. Servilius Isauricus, afterwards,{
on his first reconciliation with Antonius, to a step-daughter of the lafter‚{
Clodia or Claudia, daughter of Fulvia by P. Clodius. His marriage}
with Scribonia was contracted in 714, B.c. 40, to conciliate Sex. Pom-3
peius, whose father-in-law, L. Scribonius Libo, was her brother. Sheg
was much older than Octavianus, had been twice previously married,]
and had children by P. Cornelius Scipio 3 one of whom, Cornelia, wife=¹
of Aemilius Paullus, has been immortalised by Propertius (El. 4, 11).}
He divorced Scribonia the next year, 715, 13.c. 39, when her daughter J
