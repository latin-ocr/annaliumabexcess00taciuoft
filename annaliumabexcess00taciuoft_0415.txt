ο primoribus Macedoniae. It is very
possible that he was a Macedonian who,
through a patronus of that name, had
received the civitas, and had thus the
'privilege of trial before the praetor’s
court at Rome (cp. ‘ increpitis iudicibus ');
bpt, as such persons more commonly take
*mly the gentile name of their patronus,

Ἴ like Julius Sacrovir, Orelli may be right
η h supposing him to be a Roman resident
h Macedonia.

’ 3. 0011811113 permixtum: cp. fnego-

' trismixti‘ 11. 24, 10.

mtto} This has generally been taken
to a blundering interpolation, as Taci-
’ tuswould hardly have forgotten that he
kq made Cotys the nephew of Rhescu-
poris (ι. 64, 3).

4. bellum . . . volverat, ‘had con-
templated war:’ cp. ‘ animus . . . bellum

η aqua ot igni interdictum reo, the

, Phil. . 4, 10), varied by Tacitus to ‘ar-
un' (c. 23, 2; 50, 6) or ‘prohiberi ’ (16.
12, 1). This was the ordinary and proper
. penalty for ‘maiestas’ (cp. c. 50, 6).

here more distinc'ssy objective than that of

like ‘ insolens contumeliae ’ 6. 34, 1, etc ,
and similar instances in Cic., Caes, etc.
sse Roman rule so new to them was
that of Trebellienus, whose position was
that of a governor; the princes in whose
name he ruled being not only minors‚ but
absent in Rome (see note on 2. 67, 4).
discors, ‘ seditious:’ cp. 1. 38, 1, etc.

9. popularium inim-ias . . . sinere.
The sentence is obscure from its brevity.
Trebellienus is accused of oppressing the
people‚ and Rhoemetalces of permitting·
it. 'Hie inf. is only here found with ‘in-
cusare,’ only, apparently, in 4. 22, 43 14.
18, 1, with ‘ accusare.’

10. Coelaletae. In Pl. N. H. 4.1 1. 1 r,
41, this name is generally read ‘ Celaletae ;'
Ryck. would here read ‘ Coeletae: adap-
ted to the Κοιλητικὴ στρατηγία of Ptol. 3.
11, 9. In Dio, 54. 34, 6, we have mention
of Σιαλέται, which some MSS. read in

Dii. The MS. has ‘ alii,’ for which
Lips. restores this name from Thuc. 2.
96, 2, where the Dii of Rhodope are
joined with the Odrysae, the chief tribe
ἐντὸς . . . Αἵμου καὶ . . . Ῥοδόπης.

11. paribus . . . per ignobilitatem,
‘equally undistinguished‚‘ so that none
could assert a preeminence and combine
all under him.

13. praesentia, ‘their neighbourhood:
as opposed to ‘remotos‚’ a sense of the
word nearly similar to that in c. 34, 10,
etc.
