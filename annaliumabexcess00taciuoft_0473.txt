A.D. nadad-49 ο LIBER IV. CAP. 6.

1. societatibus equitum Romano-
rum. These associations of ‘publicani'
are called ‘vectigalium societates’ in 13.
50, 33 and apparently each province had
one: thus the ⁶ societas Bithyniae ’ is spo-
ken οἱ by Cicero (ad Fam. 13. 9, 1), and
those of provinces generally by Caesar
(Β. C. 3. 3, 2). Each was presided over
by a ‘magister' (Cic. Pl. 13, 32).

agitabantur, ‘were managed:’ so
‘agitare faenus' 6. 16, 3; G. 26, 1, ete.:
cp. also c. 41, 43 12. 27, 3, etc.

roe suas, the office ol ‘procurator
fisci! Such an officer is found even in
senatorial provinces (cp. c. 15, 3): in the
greater Caesarian provinces he answered
to the senatorial quaestor, while the les-
ser were wholly administered by him:
see Introd. vii. p. 99. Inscriptions also
attest the existence of lower officers (‘pr0-
curatores patrimonii ’), usually- freedmen,
employed by the princeps as by any pri-
vate individual, to manage his private
astuta, whether in Italy or the provinces.
See Marquardt, ii. p. 249.

3. tenebantur . . . sine modo. This
ἷξε also the mse with the ‘ legati‚‘ cp. 1.

2.
manetem-ent, in prose only here
in Quint: from Hor. and Ov.

mi annone. On the use with ‘an-
nona ' of metaphors from winter or storm,
see on 2. 87, 1.

6. obviem iit. For his own references
to his labour in this department, cp. 3.
54, 8; 6. 13, 2. ‘Annona' was also a
special care of Augustus (see on 1. 2, ι).

8. sine avaritia . . . magistratuum.
Compare the account of the republican
provincial mle (1. 2, 2): see also Introd.
vu. p. 101.

, 9. verbera, ademptiones bonorum
aberent. This can hardly mean more

than that governors were generallybrought
to account sor inflicting such punishments
unjustly: it being evident that such out-
rages were often in fact committed (see
Introd. 1. l ).

10. reri. Lips. points out that a con-
trast is suggested to the vast estates after-
wards acquired by confiscations. It ap-
pears to be also implied that he had larger
estates in the provinces: cp. c. 15, 33
Marquardt, ii. p. 249.

modesta. N otwithstanding the ap-
parent correspondence of ‘rari ' and ‘pau-
cos,' it does not seem possible to take
this. with Orelli. to mean ‘in moderate
number.’ 1t must be understood of their
demeanour, and contrasted with the ge-
neral insolence of such persons ge. g. e.
74, 6)-

intra. paucos libertos domus, ‘his
domestic staff limited to a few freedmen ’
On the use of ‘intra‘ cp. 3. 72, 5. The
household of Caesar still so sar resembled
that of a private citizen that its posts of
responsibility and confidence (¹ a libellis)
‘ a rationibus‚' etc.) were filled only by
freedmen; and these in the time of 'sibe-
rius were few. There is however evidence
(see Introd. vii. p. 90, note 2) that some
of them were wealthy and influential. Vi-
tellius had afterwards filled such posts
with Roman knights (H. 1. 58, 1): some-
times the freedmen had themselves re·
ceived equestrian or even senatorial dis-
tinctions (11. 38, 5; η. 53, 2; H. 2. 57, 4).

11. ei . . . disceptaret, i. e. all fiscal
claims were prosecuted in the ordinary law-
courts (cp. c. 15, 3; Dio, 57. 23, 5). In

2. 34, 5, his behaviour is described in a ›

case where he was interested, not perso-

nally, but on behalf of a friend.
forum et ius. The idea of a verb of

action is supplied: cp. Introd. v. §38 b.
