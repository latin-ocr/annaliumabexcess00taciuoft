1. proinde. The MS. has ‘perinde;'
but in hortatory passages, where an in·
fex-enee is drawn from facts (asin 1. 11,
3: 2.,65, 6, etc.)‚ ‘proinde‘ is required.
Ritter shows that these words are con-
stantly confused by copyists, from the
close resemblance of their abbreviated
sorms; and that ‘proinde' has here to
be restored for ‘perinde‚' asin 15. 27, 2:
the opposite alteration has been ostener
made, as in4.17‚ 13 20,6; 6. 7, 4312. 40,

of Plancina, whose acquittal was already
secured. The sentence of Cotta, given
below, shows however that no decision
had yet been taken respecting the pro-
perty of Piso or respecting his sonS.

miseratio quam invidia. On the
omission of ‘ potius‚’ see Introd. v. ξ 64,

apd other magistrates might speak at any

ζ , nme unasked. Nipp. illustrates this or·

det of prooedure by reference to Cic. ad
Q. F. 2. 1. Tacitus uses the past tense
frangebamus), because in his time the
, pn'nceps, unless he happened to be consul
(cp. Pl. Epp. 2. 11, 10), did not preside

in person over the senate, but consulted

it in writing (see note on c. 32, 1).

9. eradendum fastis, se. ‘consulari-
bus.’ The MS. has ‘ radendum ;’ but
the simple verb appears to be thus used
only in Ov. Am. 1. 11, 22 (⁴littera rasa’).
The MS. text might however be> defended
by the general frequency of such uses os
simple for compound verbs in Tacitus
(Introd. v, ξ 40).

partem, ‘half' (cp. 4. 20, 2, etc.).
This would be the share of M. Piso (cp.
‘paterna bona’ c. 18, 2), who was to
have a sum given back out of it, as what
Seneca (Cous. ad Helv. 12, 4) terms the
‘ viaticum exulum.’

10. praenomen mutaret. Thus the
praenomen ‘ Marcus’ was forbidden to
the Manlii (Liv. 6. 20, 14). This Piso
appears to havet taken {he praenomen
‘ uerus? see no e on 4. 2, 1.

11. exuta. dignitate, sc. ‘ senatoria.3
‘ Exuere ordinem' is thus used of sena-
tors (11. 25, 5, etc.)‚

12. relegaretur. This correction of
Lips. for ‘ relegatur ’ is generally adopted.
This mildest form of banishment (cp. Ov.
Trist. 2, 137) involved no ‘ deminutio ca-
pitis: or other penalty beyond itself. ,
