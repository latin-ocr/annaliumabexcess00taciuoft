10 INTRODUCTION.

To these evidences, that the ‘Annals' must have been‘written when
sources of information now lost to us were in existence, and are likely
to have been written before the date of Ptolemy‚ may be added the
testimony of Jerome, that Tacitus did write, in thirty books, the
history of the whole period, or, as he expresses it, ‘the lives of the
Caesars,’ from the death of Augustus to that of Domitian¹; an ar-
rangement of books answering to that of the second Medicean MS„
which itself purports to be transcribed from an original of the date
Aa). 395, or contemporary with Jerome ².

The much larger question of the internal evidence of style is here
necessarily omitted.

CHAPTER III.

ΟΝ THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION OPEN TO TACITUS FOR
THIS PERIOD3 AND THEIR PROBABLE VALUE.

jz 1. WnrrTEN narratives of the general history of the period or of parts
of it.

J It is not the habit of Tacitus to name his informants ; and in the
first six books he has done so twice only, citing the history of the
German ..wars hyrc. Plinius ⁵, and the memmssnt.„thecyoungersAgri„p;
pina, in each case for an incident relating to the elder Agrippina ⁴. It
is stated in the one case, and apparently implied in the other, that
he is taking from a less usual source something overlooked by those
whom he generally follows. In the later books we have references
t0 the genef-ql, ,history 9lsffPlir11y ⁵, tqrssluyiQ-Rssquj, ‚tQQEabiustpsticus ⁷,
and to Domitius Corbulo ⁸. ’ ’

General references are far more comm0n; and give evidence that
there were many such works, and that his history was mainly drawn
from them ⁹. ’

Of these many, a few* names only can be now supplied. In extant
