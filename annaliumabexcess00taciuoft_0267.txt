3. tulit. This may only mean ‘ per-
mitted ;’ but Nipp. is probably right in
interpreting it by ‘laturum sententiam'
above, as meaning that he gave the first
vote for acquittal. On the acc. and inf.
cp. c. 72, 2.

absolvi. Suetonius (Tib. 58). if he
is telling the same story, appears to speak
inaccurately. ‘ Statuae quidam Augusti
caput deluserat, ut alterum imponeret:
acta res in senatu est, et, quia ambigeba-
tur, per tormenta quaesita est. Damnato
re0,' etc.

4. reciperatores. F requent mention
is made of such a judicial board, one of
’,. their chief functions being the assessment
. of claims preferred by provincials against
ζ Romans. Thus in Liv. 43. 2, 3, five sena-

tors, under this title, are appointed by
the praetor at the instance of the senate,
to adjudicate on the complaint of Spain.
'See also Liv. 26. 48, 8 ; and Weissenborn
ad loc. 1t is here implied that the trial
uf Marcellus became a mere civil question
or dmmges, the criminal charges letng
dropped. Pliny (Epp. 2. 11, 2) protests
against an attempt to give a similar turn
to the trial of Marius Priscus, ‘ excessisse
Priscum immanitate et saevitia crimina
quibus iudices dari possent, cum ob inno-
centes condemnandos, interficiendos etiam,
pecunias accepisset: Cp. also Id. 4. 9, 16 ;

. 29, 10. v

5. in cornu tribunalis. The state-
ment os Suetonius (Tib. 33 ; cp. Dio, 57. 7,
6), that he sat ‘iuxtim vel ex adverso in
ξε primori,’ appears to imply that the
’ca was one with a tribunal at each
end, and that he either sat beside the
pxaetor or in the corresponding place

3 , opposite to him.
' 6. curuli. The use of this word with—

out ‘sella' is peculiar to writers of the
silver age.

7. potentium preces. i. e. those os in-
fluential ‘advocati ‘ present in court.
This would be thus a particular form of
‘ambitusss rather than a synonym for it.
Suetonius (l. l.) gives a more detailed
description, ⁶ si quem reorum elabi gratia
rumor esset, subitus aderat, iudicesque aut
e plano aut e quaesitoris tribunali legum
et religionis et noxae, de quo cognoscerent,
admonebat? Cp. ‘accessit . . . iudiciis gra-
vitas ’ Vell. 2. 126, 2.

8. veritati. This word is here nearly
equivalent to ‘ aequitas? cp. ‘ veritas
mea’ 3. 16, 5; ‘ex vero statuisse ' 4. 43,
4; also ‘verum' Hor. Epp. 1. 7, 98 ; 12,
²33 Liv. 2. 48, 2; 3. 40, 113 and ‘iudi-
cem a veritate depelli ' Quint. 5, Proem.

libertas, ‘ the independence of judges.'
Tacitus, though he has been blamed
for this sentiment, is plainly no de-
sendet of judicial corruption, but may
have rightly held the coercion ofjudges K
by the princeps to be liable to result in
still more flagrant injustice than that )
which it might prevent.

inter quae. These words appear only
to connect this case with his general
interest in questions of justice3 for the
context, ‘ auxilium patrum invocabat:
shows that this is not an action at law,
but a petition to the senate.

9. senator. The apparently super·

fluous use of this word here and in 3. 36,
2 is generally taken to imply that the per-
sons are ‘ pedarii senatores ' (cp. 3. 65, 2)
only. Where it is used (eg 4. 31, 7;
11. 35, 7) of ‘ praetorii,¹ it is to distinguish
them srom thenon-senatorial persons men·
tioned in the passage.

mole. N ipp. argues that, as ¹ duc-
tus ' means ‘the opemtjonsof conducting '
os water, ‘ moles ‘ is ⁴ the construcfion ' of
the road, as in ⁵ machinas molemque
