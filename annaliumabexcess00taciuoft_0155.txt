ifelt a leaden rule upon them: far higher elements of national lise are
‘stagnating under peril and suspicion; and the result is a barrenness of
intellectual activity, compared to which even the time of Nero or Domitian
is an age of fertility.

CHAPTER IX.

GENEALOGY OF THE FAMILY OF AUGUSTUS AND OF THAT
OF THE CLAUDIAN CAESARS, WITH NOTES.

- meo to constant intermarriages between members of the imperial
family, the relationships between many of the persons whose names
30ccur in these tables are extremely intricate, even without considering
vthe further complication introduced by adoptions. Thus the children
of Germanicus are on their mother’s side direct descendants of Au-
gustus, and on their father's side direct descendants of Octavia, as well
tas descendants of the Claudian house. The emperor Nero, besides
partaking of all these relationships through his mother, was also directly
>descended from Octavia on his father’s side. All the descendants of
Drusus, brother of Tiberius, trace a similar descent through Antonia;
:the children of Drusus, son of Tiberius, become members of that
<family through Livilla; and the children of Claudius by Messalina are
again through her father and mother doubly descendants of Octavia.
>Tiberius and the two Drusi, his brother and son, are thus the only
‘members of the Claudian stock who stand in no blood-relationship

{igstssy all the relationships of consanguinity. Of the adoptions, the

{aulius Caesar, of Tiberius by Augustus, of Germanicusdby Tiberius,
{aad of Nero by Claudius.
