NOTE.—Several of the works on this subject are mentioned by Nipp. (Introd. p. 33);
to whose list of various judgments may be added the vigorous defence of Tiberius by
Professor Beesly (ε Catiline, Clodius, and Tiberius,’ London, 1878), the more modified A
praise in M. Duruy's History, the more unsavourable view taken by M. Boissier in his 3
work, ‘L'Opposition sous les Cesars’ (especially ch. 6, on the delators), and the '
un‘measured invective of Comte Champagny (Les cesars, i. p. 280-360).

Many obligations, not easy to specify in their places, must be here acknowledged
to several of these works; but my chief endeavour has been to give an independent
judgment on the facts and interpretations of facts contained in Tacitus and other
original authorities.

TAcrrus would undoubtedly wish his readers to take, as his most
deliberate judgment on Tiberius, the summary at the end of the Sixth '
Book, where his life is marked out into periods, showing a gradualv Ἴ
moral deterioration‚ affecting both his private habits and personal
government¹. It will therefore be convenient to examine these suc· 3
cessively. „

This emphatic praise, from so unfavourable a witness, though perhaps Ξ
qualified by insinuations of latent cruelty2, and tales, which we seem {3
intended to believe, of a foretaste at Rhodes of Capreae³· ‚ must at least 3
be taken as an admission that his public life to his 56th year was un-
impeachable‚ and seems to carry with it a disbelief in the tales of Ξ
drunkenness caught up by Suetonius& Ξ

year of Philippi⁶ (712, B. c. 42), he shared in unconscious insane? the -3
