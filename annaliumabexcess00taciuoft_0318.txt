crebrescit, ‘the story grows.’ The
verb is first found in Verg.‚ and is used
by Tacitus in this sense in H. 2. 67, 13
but here alone with aec. and inf. The
more ordinary sense is found in 3. 60,
2, etc. ·

1. apud. . . . rursum: see note on 1.
31, 5³ 80, 3·

3. obscuro diei: cp. ‘sero diei' c. 21,
4; ⁶ obscuro . . . coeptae lucis’ H. 4.
50, 2.

5. inem-tim in contrast to ‘visu,' as
‘ festinatione! to ⁴ mora.' On such neuter
plurals used for abst. nouns, see Introd. v.
ἓ 4 0·

valescunt: cp. 4. 61, 2; 6. 42, 2;
H. 1. 32, 4. The verb appears to be
taken from Lucr. 1. 942, etc. .

relinquebat famam aut praeve-
niebat3 i. e. when he left a place. it was
because he was becoming too well
known5 when he chose another to visit,
it was one where the story had not spread.
We should rather have expected ‘ praeve-
niebat et relinquebat.’

9. celebrabant=‘colebant,' as ‘ ob·
sequio aliquem celebrare’ 16. 33, 1: cp.
the similar use of ‘ frequentabatur ⁹ of the
pseudo-Drusus (5. 10, 3). It is thought
by Ritt. and Doed. that Clemens did not

venture into Rome 3 but it is more natural

to take ⁴ celebrabant’ in the same sense
in both clauses, and it seems otherwise to
be implied that he was arrested within
the city.

10. suum, emphatic, as ‘libertum
suum' H. 2. 65, 3. The establishment Δ
of Agrippa, irrespectively of his banish- ³
ment, vested strictly in Augustus as his
adoptive father (see Suet. Tib. 15); and «,
any slaves retained, when his property Α,
was made over to the ‘aerarium militare’ ’ ’-
(Dio, 55. 32, 2), would have passed to i
the heirs of Augustus. gs

11. vanescere: cp. c. 82, 83 4. 37, 5; g}
5. 9, 1, etc. The verb is poetical, but in 't
Quint. and Pl. Ep. ἢ

12. ambiguus: cp. c. 24, 6. ἐξ

13. Sallustio Crispo: see 1. 6, 6. ζ,

15. conscientia, ‘ complicity2' cp. ῥὲ
‘conscii’ 1. 48, 4, etc. Their pretence
was not that they believed him to be
Agrippa, but that they understood his ³³³.
plot, and would help it. „f ἦ

16. pericula. This may possibly mean 'iffi
‘ daring deeds‚' as perhaps ‘ eviluissent 'i
pericula sua' (H. 3. 53, 1); or the cona
struction may be pregnant (=‘ societatem ’ὖ
periculorum’)‚ as others noted in In-
trod. v. § 8 .

to agree with W'olfflin (Philol. 30, 744),
