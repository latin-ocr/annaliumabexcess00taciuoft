this form (as H. 4, 71, 6; 76, 5), with
Sall. (Jug. 89, 2) and Liv. (2. 46, 3),
rather than ‘ ad manus.‘

eniterentur: cp. ‘enisus' 1. 70, 6.

1. classem. A ‘ classis Syriaca' is
mentioned in inscriptions (Orelli 3604;
Henzen 6924; Wilmanns 1637; C. Ι. G.
3125, ²346 e, etc.).

„ adpugnarm a Tacitean word, only
εξ in 4. 48, 4315. 13, 1; in each instance

denoting a seint attack.

2. pro muris; not in the sense of
‘ pro munimentis’ (c. 80, 5), but as in
e. 13, 4, etc. .
mdo, ‘buffeting himself :' cp.
⁷ · 6. 35. 35 ⁵ mulieres adflictare se’ Sall. Cat.
1, .
ᾗ 3 3? seditionem coeptabat: cp. 1. 38, 1,
κ’ etc.
’ 4. signifer: see on r. 48, 2. The
³ sixth legion was supposed to be most
3 inclined to favour Piso (c. 79, 3).
2sff. 5. occanere. Tacitus appears to fol-
3 low Sallust (see Introd. v. ξ 97, 1) in the
me of a verb not found elsewhere. The
form ‘occino' is used only of the note of
6. peti aggerem. This is best ex-
, plained like ‘petendus agger’ 1. 65, 10
(where see note). The material to be
collected is here intended to fill the ditch
τ or make the wall easier to scale: hence
the addition ‘ erigi scalas.‘ Thus we find
. ὶιι Caesar (Β. G. 5. 9, 6) ⁸ aggere ad mu-
* mtiones adiecto locum ceperunt) Vege-
’ tius (4, 15) also describes such a mound
÷ ...- &arguerem

the wall be assaulted ; ' but Tacitus would
hardly use ‘ agger’ of the wall of a strong
fort, though Vergil (Aen. 10, ²3) has
‘ aggeribus murorum‚’ and Servius (ad loc.)
says that all fortifications may be loosely
called ‘aggeres’

7. et faces. On the conj. after asyn-
deta, see Introd. v. ξ 90, and instances
collected here by Nipp.

9. dum . . . consulitur. On the use
of the indic. here, see Introd. v. § 49.

12. At Romae; a favourite surm of
transition: cp. 1. 7, 1; 46, 1: 3. 22, r 3
6. 29, 1, etc.

valetudo, sc. ‘adversa : '
58, 2 ; 6. 7, 4, etc.

percrebruit. Here, and in 12. 6, 5;
15. 19, 1, Halm corrects the MSS. text
to this form, which is given by them in
other places (6. το, 2 ; H. 2. 26, 3). Orell.
and Nipp. are perhaps right in reading
⁸ percrebui ¹ or ‘ percrebrui ’ according to
the MSS. in each place, and treating the
variations as those of the author. See
Introd. v. § 85.

13. ut=‘ut fieri solet :’ cp. 1. 65, 4, etc.

aucta in. deterius, ‘ exaggerated sor
the worse! On the force of ‘in ' in such
constructions, see Introd. v. ξ 60 b. ¹

dolor ira. It seems best so to punc-
tuate as to suppose ⁵ erant' to be sup-
plied with these words, as in H. 2. 29.
5 (‘ gaudium miseratio favor'): thus
‘erumpebant questus’ is more emphatic
thanis ‘erumpebat' were to be supplied
from it in the former place.

14. extremas terras. Syria was one of
the ‘imperii extrema’ (cp. 4. 74, 2) but
