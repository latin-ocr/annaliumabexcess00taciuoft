dehinc Ptolemaei per id bellum studiis repetitus ex vetusto more
honos* missusque e senatoribus qui scipionem eburnum‚ togam
pictam, antiqua patrum munera, daret regemque et socium atque ,

amicum appellaret.

5 27. Eadem aestate mota per Italiam servilis belli semina fors 1

oppressit.

auctor tumultus T. Curtisius, quondam praetoriae

cohortis miles, primo coetibus clandestinis apud Brundisium et
circumiecta oppida, mox positis propalam libellis ad libertatem
vocabat agrestia per longinquos saltus et ferocia servitia, cum
10 velut munere deum tres biremes adpulere ad usus commeantium

not have been eognisant of the action of

their king; andis they had been so, Halm

lr²i{,3htly notesd that gig-emulsa gens ' would
ave re urre no a mon.

Ι. regemus, ‘was revived.‘

ex vetusto more honos missus-
que. Halm and Orelli have followed
Doed. in extracting this text from the
MS„ which has ‘ ex uetusto more omis-
susque‚’ with dots above and below ‘o.’
The older editions and Nipp follow Lips.
in reading ‘ ex vetusto mos missusque3'
but Doed.'s reading is supported by Her·
aeus from c. 16, 2 ; and ‘ vetere ex more'
(c. 27, 2), etc.

2. togam pictam, i. e. ‘triumphalem’
(Pl. N. H. 8. 48, 74. 195).

3. antiqua munera. According to
Livy (30. 15, 11), Masinissa received
through Scipio the same gifts·‚ with the
addition of a curule chain which was
also probably sent to Ptolemaeus, as it
is represented, with the sceptre, on his
coins (see Dict. of Biog.). Similar gifts
were sent to Porsena (Dion. Hal. 5. 35),
and probably to Ariovistus (Caes. B. G.
1· 43, 4>-

5. mota . . . semina, ‘the seeds al-
ready scattered.’

6. Gurtisius3 not otherwise known as
a Roman name. Nipp. suggests that per·
hgps it should be read ‘Curtilius’ (13.
5 , 5, etc.).

8. positia, ⁶ published : ’ cp. 1. 7, 5.

9. longinquos, probably best taken as
‘remote;’ referring to the Appennine
forests as at some distance from any such
town as Brundusium. The alternative
translation ‘extensive,’ may perhaps de-
rive support from the meaning of ‘longin-
quitas' in 3. 5, 4; 6. 44, 4.

10. biremes; ‘Liburnae,’ as distinct

from triremes (App. Ill. 3; Luc. Phars.
3, 534), from the fleet of Ravenna: see
Introd. vii. p. 109. These would a pear
to have had a naval patrol in the A riatie
for the protection or assistance of traffic.
For the use of ⁶ adpellere,' see note on 2.

413 Cutius. This name is found in in-
scriptions (cp. Wilmanns 1178); and the
correction to ‘ Curtius ’ is therefore need-
less.

12. provincia .
Orelli retains the MS. text ‘eveneratss
while Halm follows Haase, as above«
Nipp. and many others follow Lips. in.
reading ‘ Cales ' for ‘ calles? The quaes-j
torian ¹ provinciae ’ in Italy are called b!
Dio (55. 4, 4) an institution of Augustutf:
but are probably connected with the ina
stitution of four ‘quaestores classici‘ 011
the conquest of Italy: see on 11. 22, 8?
and Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p. 556. One
of these ‘provinciae' is the well known:
‘ Ostiensis,' which had important dutieq
connected with the corn supply of Romev
(Cic. Mur. 8, 18; Sest. 17, 39; Vell. ας
94, 1); another the ‘Gallica‚‘ with itu
station perhaps at Ariminum, and extends
ing later over ἡ περὶ Πάδον Γαλατία (ΡΜ-ΕΞ
sert. 4). A third was evidently placed a}
South Italy, ”but its designation is unce&
tain. Cicero (Att. 2. 9, 1) speaks of ΙΨ
quaestor at Formiae, also (in Vatin. 'v
12) of assigning duties at Puteoli to .-
who had by lot an ⁶ aquaria provin ,τὲ
(see Momms. 1. 1.). The conjecture <ff l
Lipsius, designating this province frod ,
Cales, is supported by Mommsen (1. 1³
who thinks that this, the oldest Lati& ³
colony in Campania, may have been d*-
the time of the conquest of Italy, suffici·
ently important to have been the head· ’
