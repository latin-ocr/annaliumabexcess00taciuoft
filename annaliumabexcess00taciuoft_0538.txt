Neapolis in exchange the more important
island Aenaria (Ischia), and had taken
a fancy to it and erected a villa, where
he spent some days shortly before his
death (Suet. 98). For further account of
its topography, see Mr. Bunbury (in Dict.
of Geog.)‚ and a description in Bentley's

eoves exist on the north and south, on
either side of the modern town of Capri,
which lies in the depression between the
eastern and western precipices. The
southern, or ‘piccola marina‚‘ shows
traces of having been the ancient port.

ledge of the sentine1.' The point of out-
look would probably be on the eastern
precipice‚ sacing the mainland, where the
remains of the Pharos, mentioned by
Suet. (Tib. 74) and Statius (Silv. 4. 5,
100), still exist.

4. obiectu montis: cp. ‘obiectu la-

shelter it, and their principal elevation is

The meaning is clear, but the expression
harsh from its brevity: ‘its summer cli-
mate, as it faces the west and has open
sea around, is lovely.' Favonius denotes
the westerly wind beginning to blow
earlyin February (Plin. H. Ν 2.47, 119,
122, etc..) The high position of Ana
Capri, towering above the depressiou in
which the town lies, occupies the western
portion, with the hig hest point (Monte
Solar) immediately above it.
