the senate, or rather with the senator
who held comitia as ‘interrex,’ to allow
him to stand for the consulship without

being duly qualified.

That of Brundusium was made in 714,
B.C. 40: that of Tarentum in 717, B.C. 37.
N ipp, also explains the inversion here of
their chronological order, as meant to lay
stress on the marriage with Octavia
(‘ subdola affinitas’)‚ which was one of
the provisions of the earlier treaty.

by some German tribes in 738, B.C. 16
(Dio. 54. 20, 5), though ‘maioris in-
famiae quam detrimenti ’ gSuet. Aug. 23),
involved the loss of an eagie, and caused
Augustus to go as far as Gaul (Vell. 2. 97,
1): on the ⁵ clades Variana,’see c. 3, 6, etc.

lianas’ and ‘Varianas,’ are rhetorical

an Egnatius, an Iulus.’ L. Licinius Mu-
raena (Hor. Od. 2. 10), afterwards by
adoption Terentius Varro Muraena, suf-
fered death with Fannius Caepio for con-
spiracy against the life of Augustus in
731 οι· 732, B.c. 23 or 22 (Dio, 54. 3;
Vell. 2. 91). He was brother to Pro-
culeius and Terentia (Di0‚1.1.). Egna-
tius Rufus, a popular aedile and praetor
in two successive years, failing afterwards
to reach the consulship, formed a plot
with others against the life of AugustuS,
and was put to death in prison in 735,
B.c. 19. Velleius loads him with abuse
(2. 91, 3). Iulus Antonius, son of the
triumvir by Fulvia, was advanced by
Augustus to the highest rank, and mar-
ried to Marcella, daughter of Octavia;
see Introd. ix. note 18. The MS. here
and 3. 18, 1; 4. 44, 5, reads his name as
‘ Iulius‚' but ‘ Iulus’ is restored from
Hor. od. 4. 2, 2, and Di0‚ 51. 15, 7; see
Nipp. He was forced to suicide in 752,
B.c. 2, for adultery with Julia (Vell. 2.
100, 4); which was held to amount to
treason (see 3.· 24, 3).
