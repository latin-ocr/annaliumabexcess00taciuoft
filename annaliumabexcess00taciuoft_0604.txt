2. feruntque, etc. This legend is given
more fully, with some variation, in Just.
4²· 2, 12. Jason is there said in aster
life to have been driven from Thessaly
by the daughters of Pelias, to have been
reconciled to Medea, to have reinstated
Aeetes, whom he found in exile, to have
gained great victorIes, and assigned a
territory from his conquests to his sol-
lowers from Greece. The Albani, ac-
cording to Justin, gave to Cn. Pompeius
a different account of themselves, and
claimed the favour of Rome as having
had their home on the Alban Mount, and
having followed Heracles from Italy to
the East. The real origin of both nations
appears to be Scythic‚ and the Albani have
been thought to be the same as the
Alauni or Alani.

3. quatempestate : cp. 2.60, 2; 414, 2.

4. vacuos ε cp. c. 51, 4; 2. 3, 2, etc.
It would seem that Tacitus took the le-
gend as asserting that Aeetes was dead.

5. de nomine, ‘ named after him:’ cp.
1. 15, 3. The Jasonian legend was widely
spread in those regions. Strabo speaks
(11. 4, 8, 503) of temples (Ἰασόνια) and
other ὑπομνήματα, not only in Albania
and Hiberia, but also in Media and Ar-
menia. Justin adds (42. 3) ‘ Iasoni totus
ferme Oriens ut conditori divinos honores
templaque constituit.² See also Grote
(vol. i. ch. 13, p. 328, sqq.), who points
out the stimulus given to these legends
by the Thessalians who had followed
Alexander.

‘Mede,’ ‘Persian‚' and ‘Parthiam’ and
