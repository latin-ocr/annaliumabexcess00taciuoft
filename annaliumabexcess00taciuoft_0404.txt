CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 773.

29. Per idem tempus Neronem e liberis Germanici, iam in- l
gressum iuventam, commendavit patribus, utque munere capes-
sendi vigintiviratus solveretur et quinquennio maturius quam
per leges quaesturam peteret, non sine inrisu audientium postu-

This would be, as is here stated, a partial
and temporary relief‚ not amounting to
any alteration of the law itself.

1. Neronem. On his age, etc„ see
Introd. ix. note 11.

3. vigintiviratus. On the separate
magistracies thus collectively designated,
see Introd. vii. p. 77; on the qualifica-
tions sor the candidates for the quaestor-
ship, Id. p. 803 Momms. Staatsr. i. p.

. 526, s011.

4. per leges. The old ‘lex Villia
Annalis’ of 574, Β. C. 180 (Liv 40. 44, 1),
had now been modified‚ probably by Au-
gustus. Tiberius, who is here stated to
have himself had only the same privilege
as that which he requests, was quaestor in
his nineteenth year (Vell. 2. 94, Ι). Mae-
cenas is represented (Dio, 52. 20, 1) as
recommending twenty -five as the earliest
age for a senator. It would thus appear
that the twenty- -fourth or twenty fifth year
was at this time the earliest legal or cus-
tomary age for the quaestorship.

non sine ini-ism because a request
which could not be refused was a mock-
e .

ry5. praetendebat: so, with inf ‚ 6. 18,
4: cp. c. 59. 6. The dispensing decrees
passed for Tiberius and Drusus in 730,
735, B. c. 24. 19. are megioned in Dio,
53. 28, 3; 54. 10, 4. ermanicus ap-
pears to have had a similar privilege, and
to have held'the consulship immediately
after the quaestorship (Suet. Cal. 1).

7. ac tamen, i.e. yet such a request
was not then so ludicrous sor a refusal
was not so out of the question. Three
reasons are given for this difference.

auctum dehinc gaudium nuptiis Neronis et Iuliae Drusi4

initia fastigii Caesaribus erant,
‘the supremacy of the Caesars was but v
beginningz’ cp. ‘praeumbrante impera-
toris fastigio’ 14. 47,1; also c. 56, 2;
73, 33 6. 32, 1, etc.

9. levior necessitudo, ‘the tie of con· ζ
nexion was slighter.' Thence it might be ε
supposed that Augustus cared less about ξ
the request than Tiberius. ‚2¹

pontificatus.1t would appear from '⁸
inscriptions that Tacitus confuses the 3
priestly offices given to Nero, with those
of his brother Drusus, See Introd. ix.
notes 11, 12.

10. quo primum die, etc. This ‘dies
tirocinii’ (Suet. Tib. 5 4) is shown by a
sragmentary kalendar to have been June
7²¹ vii Idus Iun. Nero to[gam virilem]-
sumpsit cong. d.‘ (Henzen 6443). These

‘congiaria‚’ formerly gifts of oil, wine,
etc. (Liv. 25. 2, 83 Pl. N. H. 14. 14, 17,
96) were now usually given in money.

Suet. Ner. 7; and a full account of 1118111ῗῖ

to the daughter of Creticus Silanus, see 2.

Vergil (Aen. 8, 9ο), who, as also Horace ¹
