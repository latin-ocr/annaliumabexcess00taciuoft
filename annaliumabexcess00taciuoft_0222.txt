1. de imperatore rapti. These words
contain the explanation of ‘turpi agmine.’
The moneybags may indeed have been
unusually paraded on this occasion;
otherwise, the practice of depositing
money with the standards, in custody of
the standard bearers, was encouraged,
and even to some extent enforced‚ to
make the soldier thrifty, and to bind him
to the colours (Veg. 2, 20). Domitian
however considered it advisable to limit
{ich man's deposit to 1000 H. S. (Suet.

om. .

2. egam-iorem: cp. c. 31, 2. On
these legions, see Introd. vii. p. 103.

7. in Chaucis. This tribe occupied a
very large space (G. 35), apparently on
either side os the lower Weser. Pliny
(N. H. 16. 1, 1, 2) divides them into
‘maiores' and ‘minores ς’ of whom the
latter, along the coast between the Weser
and Ems (cp. 2. 24, 3), were under Ro-
man control (cp. c. 60, 3); but, like
their neighbours the Frisii (4. 72, ι),
appear afterwards to have revolted (11.
18313 H. 4. 79, 3; 5. 19, 23 Suet. Cl.
24 .

coeptavere. This verb, rare else-
where in prose, is often used by Tacitus
to express an attempt, whether successful
or otherwise: cp. c. 45, 2; 2. 81, 1; 4.
19⁹Sfx'reffi’lladr‘iti? ‘ detachments? The
‘veterani sub vexillo' cannot be here

meant, as they do not appear to have left
headquarters rep. c. 35, 2: 39, 1).
discordium, ‘ disaffected? Thus ‘ dis-
sideat ’ (c. 46, 1); ⁸ discordare ' (3.
40, 4) ; ‘discordia' (H. 2. 76, 9), etc.,
are used of soldiers, not as disagreeing
among themselves, but as insubordinate
and mutinous. ¹ ,

9. Μ’. Ennium The MS. has ‘Men-
nius,’ which is not a known Roman
name; and the correction is supported hy
the error ‘Lennium’ for L. Ennium in, 3.
70, 2, and by the general practice of men-
tioning officers of this rank by two names
(c. 20, 1 ; 13. 39, 2). The preference of
M', rather than M, as the praenomen,
rests on a suggestion of the possible iden-
tity of ,this person with a Μάνιος Ἔννιος
mentioned in the Pannonian war (Dio,
55- 33, 2)-

10. concesso iure: see on c. 20, ¹5
26, 3.

1 1. intumescente motu: cp. ‘quoniam
Galliae tumeant' (H. 2. 32, ι). Similar
metaphors, originating apparently in the
⁸ monet . . . tumescere bella’ of Verg. G.
1. 465, are found in Liv„ etc.

15. ripam. No river has been mention-
ed: we should hence suppose the bank to
be that of the Rhine‚ as in c. 36, 2; but
the position of the Chauci would make a
more distant river, such as the Amisia,
more probable.

16. hiberna. Probably at ‘Vetera;’
