factus . . . et exercitus 14. 56, 5. Among earlier writers, Horace mo
frequently uses this Graecism. Dr. ξ. 152 b, Roby 1361, Kenned3

48. ‘Phe Historie present is extremely frequent. It, is so far treated}
as a past tense as to be once coupled with the perfect, H. 3. 16, 4 miss}
cetur intulitque3 and to be coupled with an imperfect in a dependent}
clause, as nihil reliqui faciunt quominus .. . permoverent 1. 2 1, 4 ; especially}
(as in Cicero, etc.) when such a clause precedes it, as ut omitteret maritumJ3

emereatur 13. 44, 1. Dr. ξ 27 c. l

49. Tacitus carries much further the usage, very rare before Livy, of}
interposing, in the midst of ‘ oratio obliqua: a parenthetica or}
explanatory relative clause in the indicative. Parenthetieal clauses}
are found chiefly with dum, as 2.·81‚ 33 13. 15, 7; 14. 58, 43 15. 45‚;
63 59, 6, etc.; also with quia 3. 6, 5; 4. 25, 1, etc.; with sive 1. 10, 1 ;]
with postquam 4. 10, 3 ; with quotiens 14. 64, 5. Among the relative'
clauses are qui fecere 1. 10, 13 quae petiverant 1. 36, 43 quae expres-
serant 1. 39, 3; and many others. Dr. § 151, Nipp. on 1. 10. On
other parentheses see ξ 80, and on other changes from ‘ obliqua' to
¹ recta oratio‚' see § 94.

50. The rhetorical use of the indicative for subjunctive in the
’ apodosis of conditional sentences, when the leading proposition is con-
ceived as independent of the condition (see Madv. 348, Zumpt 519), is
remarkable in Tacitus for its frequency.

(a) In the perfiet or he‘storz'cal present, with suppression or contraction
of the proper apodosis‚ as bellum . . . mandat, ni deditionem properavissent
’ 2. 22, 3 (as though ‘ et bellum iis illatum esset' had been added). Cp.
16. 28, 3; H. 1. 64, 43 Agr. 4, 1. Dr. ξ 199.

(b) In the zmperflcl.

(1) Of an incomplete action or tendency,to show vividly whatwas
on the point of happening3 the protasis almost invariably (an exception
is noted in 1. 23, 3) following the apodosis, and being almost invariably
introduced by ‘ ni‚' as ferrum parabant, ni 1. 23, 6 ; deferebat . . . , ni 35, 53
trudebantur . . . ‚ ni 63, 3 3 and very many others. Dr. ξ 194, Roby 1574.
An ellipsis may be supposed here as in the case above.
⁸ (2) To express what might, would, or should have been, in
forcible contrast to what actually is, as si. . . aspernaretur, tamen
