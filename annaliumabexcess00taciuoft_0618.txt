vestal Laelia (15. 22, 4) was probably his
daughter. His further fate is mentioned
in c. 48, 7.

Iunius Otho, apparently son os the

praetor of 775, A D. 22 (3. 66, 2). The ,

veto of the tribune is still occasionally
exercised (see Introd. vi. p. 76).

‘exilium‚’ as apparently required to ex-
plain ⁴ suturis caedibus ' above.

4. Albucilla: see c. 48, 6. Probably
she also may have been put to death by
Gaius.

Satrio Secundo: see 4. 34, 2. He
is mentioned more prominently than as if
he were only one of the many informers
respecting the conspiracy of Seianus (see
5. 8, 1, etc.), and may therefore have been
the person who betrayed it to Antonia
(see Appendix iii. p. 539). The past
tense used in speaking of him here and
in c. 8, 10 suggests that he was probably
dead.

6. Gn. Domitius, the husband of
Agrippina: see 4. 75, 1.

Vibius Marsus: see on 2. 74, 1.
Nipp. thinks he may be the poet spoken
of slightingly in Mart. 4. 29, 7 (‘quam
levis in tota Marsus Amazonide ’); most
allusions to a poet of the name being,

no doubt, to the more famous Domitius
Marsus.

10. commentarii, ‘the ecord : ’ the
word is used of any written record, as of
the ‘acta senatus’ (15. 74, 2) and the
register of the princeps (H. 4. 40, 6, etc.).
Dio (58. 24, 2) represents such a case as
common. (ἡλίσκοντο οἱ μὲν πλείους ἐκ τῶν

Μάκρωνος βασάνων) ; the senate having ap-

of ‘eo’ necessary; but the pronoun can
