expression: cp. ‘quasi . . . quandam? Cic.
de Am. 13, 48.

2. nostra aetas, i⁴ e. that of Trajan.

multa. laudis et artium, ‘ many
examples os noble character and talent : '
‘ artes ' are here used sor the ‘ bonae artes ’
of 2. 73. 4, etc. In H. 1. 3, 3, he similarly
describes the age as not wholly ‘virtu—
tum sterile.’

3. haee nobis in maiores certamina..
Most editors have inserted ‘in‚’ with
Lipsius, to complete the expression. The
construction ¹ certamen in aliquem ’ is no-
where sound, the nearest parallel in Taci-
tus being ‘ambitio in posteros ' (6. 46, 4),
and other uses of ‘ in’ with the sense of
‘in relation to' (cp. 4. 11, 2,- 12. 6, 53
Introd. v. ξ 60 b); a >meaning perhaps
suitable to such a figure as that of a con-
test between those who are of different
generations. The reading preferred by
Nipp. ‘haec nos’ (se. ‘imitanda posteris
tulimus '): ‘nobis maiores’ (sc. ‘imitanda
tulerunt ’) seems too harsh and abrupt to
be possible. Joh. Miiller (Beitr. 3. p. 34)
suggests that ‘maiores‘ may have been
the corruption of ‘animorum;‘ ‘certa-
men animorum ² being, though hardly in
the same sense, a frequent phrase in Livy
(2. 59, 1 ; 4. 56, 9, etc.). For other al-
terations, see Halm, Comm. Crit. and
Baiter on Orelli.

4. ex honesto, sc. ‘ortas ‘honourable
rivalries.’

5. fama, moderationis parta. It is
of coursekbe insinuated that he utilised the
credit th is obtained for moderation to
push this request. By associating Drusus
in the tribunitian power, he would be seen
to aim at making the succession to the
principate hereditary.

6. potestatem tribuniciam, i.e‘. to be =
associated in that power with himself : J
cp. 1. 3, 33 Introd. vi. p. 82. On the
coins attesting the possession of this
power by Drusus, see Introd. ii. p. 8.

or for life, in 732, B.C. 18.

9. praemineret. The verb is of post-¹-
Augustan use only, except in Sall. Fr. H.
2. 85 D, 83 K, 50 G; where it takes au]
accus. as in the Annals (12. 12, 13 33ss
