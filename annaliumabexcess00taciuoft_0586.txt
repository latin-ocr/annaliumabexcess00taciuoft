2. inlustris eques: see on 2. 59, 4.

3. frater ggaetorius,(Por711pei1)1s Macer,

raetorin ‚A.D. 15 1. 2,4.
Ρ 4. 'I'heo7phanen Mytilenaeum. This
person took the name of Cn. Pompeius
Theophanes, and had received the ‘civi-
tas’ publicly from Pompeius in the pre-
sence of his army (Cic. Arch. 10, 24), and
also won from him sor Mitylene the privi-
leges of a free city (Plut. Pomp. 42, 641).
His history of his patron's campaigns is
mentioned by Cic. (l. l.) and Plutarch
(Pomp. 37, 639); and he is mlled by
Strabo (¹3· 2, 3, 617) ὁ συγγραφεύς. His
influence with Pompeius is mentioned in
strong terms by Cicero (Att. 5. 1 1, 3, etc.)‚
who speaks of him as still alive in 710,
B.C. 44 (Id. 15. 19, 1).

5. proavum eorum, i. e. of Pompeia
and her rother. Strabo (1. l. ' s a es
Theop anes left a son Macer (in the MS.
⁴ Marcus ²) Pompeius, who had been made
procurator in Asia by Augustus, and,
when he wrote (cir. 771, A. D. 18), was
still alive and an intimate friend of Tibe-
rius. He is also, no doubt, the ‘Pom-
peius Macer’ mentioned in Suet. Jul. 56,
as librarian of Augustus. As Theophanes
was probably of much the same age as
Pompeius or Cicero, his son may well
have been a very old man when Strabo
wrote, and thus father of the ‘illustris
eques’ here mentioned, and grandfather
of the praetor, who might have been only
thirty years old in 768, A. D. 15.

habuisset . . . tribuerat. Both verbs
appear equally to assert a matter of sim-
ple fact. Nipp. thinks that the former is
rather to be taken as the speech of the
accuser; but it would seem that only the
deification of Theophanes could by any‘
ῗῖἒξῗὲἓίἓὲῖξὛιῗῗῖἶὲιῖἒρίἶὲἷξῗγαξῗὲἓῗὲ
themselves on it. The change of mood

may be arbitrary, as it is perhaps in 1.

6. caelestes honores. Greek coins
exist inscribed Θεὸς Θεοφάνης or Θεοφάνης
Θεὸς Μυτ(ιληναίων); see Eckh. ii. 504.
This was probably an expression of grati-
tude for the privilege granted for his sake
to the city: see above.

7. Sex. Marius: see 4. 36, 1. Dio
states (58. 22, 2) that he had hitherto
been intimate with Tiberius, and illus-
trates his wealth by an anecdote.

defertur incestasse. On the constr.
cp. 2. 27, 1. The statement of Dio (1. 1.)
that Marius had only secluded his daughter
to protect her from the lust of Tiberius
himself, was perhaps unknown to or dis-
believed by Tacitus, who however thinks
he was unjustly condemned.

8. saxo . . . deicitur: see 2. 32, 5,
etc.

9. aui-arias argentm-imque. The MS.
text ‘ aurariasque ’ cannot be satisfactorily
explained except on the supposition of a
word lost. The above text is suggested
by the general celebrity of the silvei· mines
of southern Spain (see Polyb. 34. 9, 8;
Strab. 3. 2, 10, 147); while Nipp's. sug-
gestion, ‘aeran'as aurariasque,' has a special
recommendation in the mention by Pliny
(N. H. 34. 2, 4) of ‘aes Marianum, quod
et Cordubense dieitur? ‘ Auraria’ has
here alone the sense of ‘ aurifodina,’ but
‘ aeraria ’ and ⁸ argentaria ' are elsewhere
so used.

10. sibimet, i. e. took them from the
aerarium into the fiscus: see c. 2, 1;
17, 1.

11. inritatusque suppliciis. Nipp.
notes that the idea is that of a wild beast

who has tasted blood.

carcere, ‘in public custody? The
Tullianum is a mere vault and cannot
here be meant.
