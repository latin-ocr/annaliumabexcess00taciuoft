Rhescuporim quoque, Thraeciae regem, astu adgreditur. omnem 3

earn nationem Rhoemetalces tenuerat 3 quo defuncto Augustus
partem Thraecum Rhescuporidi fratri eius, partem filio Cotyi

quod incultum, ferox, adnexum hostibus, Rhescuporidi cessit:
ipsorumque regum ingenia, illi mite et amoenum, huic atrox,

avidum et societatis inpatiens erat.

cordia egere: mox Rhescuporis egredi fines, vertere in se Cotyi

auctorem utriusque regni, si sperneretur, vindicem metuebat.

2. Rhescuporim. The orthography
of this name varies even on coins, and
still more so in the MSS. of various
authors: see Lips. and Walther.

Thraeciae. On the form, cp. e. 54,
2. In Roman times the boundary be-
tween this country and Macedonia was
the Nestus (Karasu). Thrace had been
fully subject to Rome for some time, the

. last rising having been crushed in 743,

B. C. 11 (see note on 6. 10, 4), but re-
mained under native princes until Claudius
made it a province in 799, A. D. 46: see
Marquardt, Staatsv. i. p. 156, and a dis-
sertation on this dynasty by Mommsen
(Eph. Epig. ii. pp. 250 263).

3. Rhoemetalces, the first of that name,
son ofSadala and Polemocratia (Momms.).
He bears the head of Augustus on the
obverse of his coins, in token of suzerainty,
and his own on the reverse only, a
practice followed by others of this
dynasty: see Mr. Donne, in Diet. of
Biog. Mommsen (l. l. p. 254) dates his
death about 765, A.D. 12, before the
composition of Ov. ex P. 2. 9.

5. arva et. urbes, i.e. the south-eastem

art.
p 6. adnexum. Drager notes that this
word is nowhere else used in the sense of
‘vicinum,’ for which it is here a mere
variation. The ‘ hostes' would be the
wild and unsubdued tribes of the Balkan:
see 3. 38, 5; 4. 46, 1.

7. ingenia . . . erat. The sentence
appears to be so condensed as to ‘have no
construction; the sense being that their
temperament answered to the nature of

the country under their mle, the one being
gentle, the other fierce: see note on 1.
8, 5 ἶ 6· 48, 7· · ·
mite et amoenum: so ‘ ingenium
amoenum,’ used of Seneca (13. 3, 2) ; the
sense being that of ‘.attractiveness ’
Ovid, who addresses Cotys as a brother
poet (ex P. 2. 9), calls him‘ iuvenum
mitissime‘ (v. 19).
8. societatis,
power?
9. vertere in se, ‘appropriates:' so
‘occasio in se unum vertendae gloriae’
(Liv. 21. 53, 6): cp. traherem se '.(1 2,
1 etc. .
’ 12. >enimvero Hildebrand (on Apul.

‘of partnership in

Met. 4. 12, 263) cites this as an adversa· ,

tive use of the word, and Dr'ager here
notes that such use is confined to Tacitus,
Florus (2. 7, 10), and Apuleius. Among
the twelve instances of this word in
Tacitus (see Gerber and Greef, Lex.), this
does perhaps approach nearest to an ad-
versative use; but really here, as elsewhere
(eg. 1. 17,6; 4. 60, 33 6. 25. 23 35, 13
12. 64, 6), it marks the transition from
the less to the more important: Rhes-
euporis, who had been timidly aggressive
in the lifetime of Augustus, now becomes

sed primo subdola con-5

boldly and openly so: see Zumpt, Gr. 4

348, note; Hand, Turs. ii. 407.

inmttere latronum globos, repeated· ⁷

in 12 54, 4.
13. causas bello. On the apposition,

cp. 1 27, 1, etc.; Introd. v. §12 a.
14. anxium liabebat: cp. c. 57,1.
conposita, ‘a settlement‚' such as that
made by Augustus: cp. c. 57, 1.
