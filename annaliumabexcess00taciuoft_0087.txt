CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLF PRINCIPATE. 69

not now always traceable 3 besides which, other powers not clearly
belonging to the idea of either of these offices, centre in the princeps,
conceived generally as the chief magistrate and representative of the
state. s
ἦ Ι. The‘ proconsulare 1mper1um as has been seen, must have been at
first no more than was involved in the charge taken for ten years of
certain provinces¹. ‘Imperium' must belong to a definite magistracy;
all military command, from the time of Sulla, had been vested in pro-
consuls or propraetors; and the power given to Augustus would seem
only a step beyond several republican precedents ², and his own action
one of surrender rather than aggrandisementss. But his proconsular
power soon became virtually, that of his successors even sormally,
perpetua13 and when, on the cessation of his consulships in 731, Β. c. 23„
it apparently first received formal definition‚ it was made coextensivet
with the empire, and valid even within the walls of Rome. ⁴ By this aci„
the senate and people had surrendered the whole power of the sword into
his hands. Besides the command of his own provinces and his ownp
s legati, he held now an ‘imperium-maius. also over the proconsuls of
⁷ senatorial provinces⁵‚ supreme command even of troops under their
immediate orders, and the right to collect fiscal revenue there through
his own* officers⁷; nor had proconsuls power in their province over the
life of a soldier ⁸. With him rest all ordinances respecting the levy,
payment‚ and dismissal of troops, and regulation of the military hierarchy.
He levies war, makes peace or treaty ⁹, and represents the state in rela-
tion to all foreign or dependent powers. Again‚ he is the high admiral
of the empire, with fleets near at hand ¹⁰; and, besides the troops attached
to these, not only the praetorian guard, his proper household brigade,
biit even the police and night-watch of the city, owned no allegiance to
any magistrate of the republic, but only to Caesar and his prefects, and
Α formed no insignifieant force at his disposal on the spot u; while the
validity of his imperium within the walls explains his power to put to
· death citizens even of senatorial rank ¹²: and he is so far the ‘imperator ’
