mention os the son of Thrasyllus.

1. ne . . . abierim. Among the very
rare instances of this use of the perf. subj.
with present force in dependent clauses
(see Introd. v. ξ 51 c), Nipp. notes ‘ne . . .
abrogaverim’ (Liv. 8. 18, 3), ‘ hostile
potius an civile dixerim, nescio ⁷ (Flor. 3.

· 22, 1): ⁴ abire' has a simple abl. in 2. 69,

a’gicAsinii Galli. On his arrest and

ξ detention, see above, App. iii. p. 538.

 

4. sponte vel necessitate. Nipp. and
Ritt. may probably be right in reading
‘ an 3 ’ but the use of ‘ vel' in cases where
two alternatives are opposed to a third, as
in 14. 3. 2, and ‘insidias an proditionem

. vel aliquod honestum consilium ’ (H. 2. 41,

2), has been taken to justify it here, where
the two alternatives embraced by ‘incer-
tum ² are opposed, on the ground of eom-
mon uncertainty, to ‘ haud dubium ε ’ see
notes on 4. 33, 4; 14. 51, 1.

. 6. non erubuit permittere. As Gal-
lus was not formally executed‚ the right
of burial would seem to be matter of
course (see c. 29, 2). If however this
case was so far doubtful that permission

'had to be asked, it might have been
- granted without shame; so that perhaps

there is a zeugma in the sentence, and

- ‘non erubuit ⁹ belongs properly to ‘ultro

incusare: etc„ i. e. to his complaint of the
delay which he himself had caused.

7. eoram convinceretur. Gallus, ac-
cording to Dio, had been condemned by
the senate (κατεψηφίσθη) at the time of
his arrest; but the case had been reserv-
ἱᾶ, as if on appeal, till Caesar’s return to

ome.

8. consulari seni, etc„ i.e. his rank
made it absurd to suppose that his case

tradi-

was by any natural arrangement post·
poned to others.

tot consularium. Five of his sons
are known to us; Asinius Saloninus (3.
75, Ι), C. Asinius (4. 1, 1). M. Asinius
Agrippa (4. 34, 1), Asinius Gallus, ban-
ished sor a conspiracy against Claudius in
799, ΑΔ). 46 (Dio, 60. 27, 5), and Asinius
Celer, noted as a gourmand (Pl. N. H. 9.
17, 31, 67), and also put to death by
Claudius (Sen. lud. 13, 4). Of these the
second, third, and fifth were certainly
consulars: see further particulars given
here by Nipp. An inscription (1. R. N.
2499), ‚‘ Cn. Asinio, Pollionis et Agrippae

first or fourth here mentioned. All these,
being the children of Gallus by Vipsania
(see 1. 12, 6), were half-brothers of Dru-
sus Caesar.

9. Drusus . . . extinguitur. The
date of his arrest and imprisonment can
only be fixed as subsequent to the publi-
cation of the work of Velleius in 783,
A. D. 30: see App, iii. p. 538.

10. mandendo . . . tomento, Orelli

pression without detail (like ‘ veneficii sig-
na’ 2. 73, 5), more suitable to the dig-
nity of history. Ritter thinks ‘ tomentum’
should be read; but Nipp. shows that
though, in an abl. os instrument or respect,
with a singular masc. or neut. noun, the
gerund is more usual (cp. c. 45, 6, etc.),
the gerundive is found in 13. 13, 33 57,
