rhetorical application of this term to the

duo . . . agmina. The attack of
Stertinius in the rear may be supposed to
have driven the German left out into the
plain ; the advance of infantry in front to
have driven the centre into the wood‚ and
the flank attack to have dislodged the
Cheruscans, who would thus be forced
into the space between these two routed
masses.

sagittariis, i. e. the ‘ pedites sagit-
tarii,’ whose position (see c. 16, 5) would
be on the right of the Gaulish and
German auxiliaries; who, being in the
sront of the order of march, would form
the left wing in line of battle (cp. 16, 5).
Among the German cohorts would be the
Chauci ; and the Raetian and Vindelician
contingents seem to be loosely reekoned
with them.

That each aux-

by such passages as Liv. 25. 14, 4; 27.
