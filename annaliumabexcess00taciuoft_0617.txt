here is strangely inconsistent with the
reproaeh of not mring for the judgment
of posterity, with which he appears, in
4. 38, 4, to think that Tiberius was justly

’ charged.

1. incertus animi: soin H. 3. 55, 4;
Liv. 1. 7, 6, etc.

course? In such an expression, fate and

c. υ, 1).

vocibus. Besides those mentioned
here, Suet. (Cal. 11) represents him as
saying ‘exitio suo omniumque Gaium
vivere, et se natricem (serpentis id genus)
P. R.. Phaethontem orbi terrarum edu-
aare!

3. non abdita ambage, ‘ in a riddle
plain to read:’ ‘ambages' is used of
oracular and other mysterious sayings (2.
54. 53 12. 63, 2, etc.).

occidentem. Ritter thinks it ne-
cessary to insert ‘solem’ after ‘orien-
tem;‘ but Dio (58. 28, 4), who here

agrees very closely with Tacitus, omits it
(εὖγε τὸν δυόμενον ἐγκαταλιπὼν πρὸς τὸν
ἀνατέλλοντα ἐπείγῃ). This famous saying
appears to be first given as said to Sulla
by Pompeius, τὸν ἥλιον ἀνατέλλοντα πλεί-
ονες ἦ δυόμενον προσκυνοῦσιν (Plut. Pomp.

8. occides, etc. Young Tiberius was
put to death by Gaius before the close of
that same year (Dio, 39. 8, 1 ; Suet. Cal.
23), and Gaius assassinated by Chaerea
and others in 794, A.D. 41 (Dio, 59. 295
Suet. Cal. 58).

gravescente valetudine: cp. 1. 5,

9. libidinibus: see c. 1, 2.

in patientia. This is perhaps best
taken, with Walther and Doed., as=‘ me-
diis in doloribus;’ such a sense of ‘pa-
tientia' being capable of being sustained
by Sen. Ep. 78, 12 ‘tolerabilis est morbi
patientia, si contempseris id quod extre·
mum minatur;’ and 82, 18 ‘devorata
unius mali patientia.‘ The alternative
interpretation, taking it to mean ‘in (or
⁶ by ’) his enduranee‚' seems more suitable
to a simple ablative.

10. eludere: cp. 5. 5, 1, etc.

11. post tricesimum, etc. Plutarch
(ὑγιεινὰ παραγγέλματα 24, 136) quotes
Tiberius, on beai-say, as saying ὡς ἀνὴρ

maxim, says that Tiberius had never con-
sulted a physician aster the age of thirty,
and retained his health unimpaired al-
most throughout his principate.

Quint. (ιο. 1, 24) under the name of
Decimus Laelius, as a famous orator οἱ

him probably son of D. Laelius Balbus,
