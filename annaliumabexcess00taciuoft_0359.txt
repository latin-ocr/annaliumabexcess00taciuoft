the praetor to whom the‘ Quaestio per-
petua’ ‘de sicariis et veneficisss fell by

y lot. e taunt of Piso contains two as-
? sum ons, in both of which he is tech-
nIeally correct: (1) that the citation of

{⁵ . Marsus was premature (see on c. 74, 2):
ξ (2) that the trial would be by ordinary
ἐξ process of law. The words of Tiberius
ii» at the trial (3. 12, 10) contain a full ad-
mission that such would have been the
² regular course (cp. Mommsen, Staatsr. ii.
p. 112); though from the rank of the
2 parties concerned it might have been
” ², taken for granted that the case would
‚ be brought under the cognisance of the
,ἰωὴ or the princeps. See Introd. vi.

Lentulus' (3. 59, 1); ‘Iunii senatoris’
(4. 64, 3), etc. : ,see several instances col-
lected by Nip. on 5. 8. This Pacuvius
is described by Seneca (Ep. 12, 8), as
‘qui Syriam usu suam fecit’ (probably
as virtual governor under the abs ent
Lamia, 6. 27 ,2) and as having daily
rehearsed his7 own funeral obsequies.

5. corruptoribus. On this extension
os the instrumental abl„ see Introd. v.
5 27. Instances from other authors are
given in Roby 1220.

7. magnitudinem, ‘the majesty.’ The
word is used of Germanicus in c. 72, 3,
and he is also called ‘imperator ’ (3. 12,
4; 14, 1); but Orelli can hardly be right
in referring this expression to him, as the
association of‘ res publica ' points clearly
to the living‘ imperator) Tiberius, whom
Sentius claims to represent.

8. ingerens, ‘repeatedly proclaim·
ing: ’ cp.1. 72, 2.

rem publicam armis pene cp. the
expression of M. Piso : ‘ civile bellum in—
cipi· (c. 76, 4).

10. secus cadebant. ‘ Secus’ is used
as in c. 50, 3, etc.; ‘cado’ as in c. 77, 4;
6. 8, 2, etc.

11. praesentibus: cp. 1. 30, 5, etc.

12. Celenderis. Orelli retains the MS.

‘Celendris,' which appears also to be the
MS. text in Mela 1. 13, 77. Whatever
Tacitus may have written, the form of
the name here given is correct according

‘to the evidence of coins (Eckh. iii. 51,
⁸ - etc.,) and is that used by Strabo (14. 5,

3, 670), Pliny (N. H. 5. 27, 22, 92), etc.
The town belong ed to Cilicia Trachea
(see on c. 78 gg), and had a harbour
(Strab. l. 1.), and presen es its name as
Chelendreh or Kilindri.
