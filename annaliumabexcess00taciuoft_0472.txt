1. ille annus. Dio, who gives abcon-
siderable length a somewhat similar sketch
of the best period of this principate (57.
7-13N, dates a change from the death of
Germanicus, and a further deterioration
from the retirement to Capreae.

iam primum, ‘to begin:’ so 14. 31.
2 ; Verg. Aen. 8, 190, etc.

2. publiea. negotia. On the posi·
tion of the senate at this time, see Dio,
57. 7; Suet. Tib. 30; Introd. vi. pp.

7privat0rum‚ questions concerning in-
dividuals. The reference is especially
to the judicial proeesses, as still conduct-
ed before the senate, rather than ‘apud
principem.'

3. primoribus, perhaps used more
widely than in 3. 65, 2.

4. cohibebat· ipse: see 3. 47, 5; 59,
2, etc.

mandabatque honores. On the
rights of ‘commendatio ² and ‘ nominatio '
exercised by him, see Introd. vi. pp. 79,
80.

5. inlustres domi artes: see 3. 7ο. 4,
and cp. ‘studiis civilibus’ 3. 75, 1. Here
oratorical or literary, as well as juristic
aecomplishments, would be included in
the expression.

6. potiores fuisse. This may be e-
quivalent to ‘plus potuisse? ‘that no
other persons had more influence with
him' (ep. 1. 69, 6), i.e. that the best
qualified prevailed3 but it is better to
take ‘potior’ as equivalent to ‘melior,'
= ‘ preferable ’ (ep. ‘ potiora instituta’ 16.
22, 7); whereby the meaning would be
that those ehosen were plainly the most
choiceworthy.

sua. . . . speeies, ‘ retained their

,¹ prestige:’ cp. Cic. in Pis. 11, ²4 ‘mag-

num nomen est, magna species, magna
dignitas, magna maiestas consulis.’ On

ι the position and functions of all magis-

’ trates of the state at this time, see Introd.

price for the soldiers or for Rome, and 'f

vi. pp. 75, foll. Dio and Suetonius (l. 1.)
give several particulars of the outward
marks of respect shown by Tiberius to
consuls and other magistrates, and to
senators generally and other persons of
note.

7. exercita potestas, ‘had their office
exercised : ’ on ‘exer-citus: cp. 3. 67, 2.

8. leges . . . bono in usu, ‘the en-
forcement of laws was salutary,' i.e. nei-
ther too lax nor too strict. Allusion
appears to be intended to such discretion
as had been shown in dealing with the
lex Papia Poppaea (3. 28, 6), and with
the sumptuary laws (3. 55, 1). On the
important exception made in respect of
the laws of ‘maiestas,’ see Introd. viii.
pp. 121, foll. ’

9. frumentaghtdh-ezbcffl,tribute.’ The
fullest i‘irffiffii'fftion on this subject is con-
tained in Cic. Verr. A. 2. B. 3; where ς’
the requisitions relating to corn are treat· '¹2
ed* under three heads‚ ‘frumentum decu· ζ
manum’ (c. 6, sqq.), ‘emptum’ (c. 70,
sqq.)‚ and ‘aestimatum’ (c. 81, sqq.).,:j
The first would be that here referred to
as managed by publicani3 the two latter ἱ
kinds being rights of purchase at a fixed
