4. Valerius Messalinus. Tffis may
be the other consul of this year (see on

6. aram ultionis statuendam. On
such commemorative altars, see note on
1. 14, 3. The MS. text ‘ultioni’ is re-
tained by Nipp. and need not be altered 3
but the genitive is more usual.

7. tristitia. This abl. can hardly be
instrumental like ‘opertus infamia’ (c.
69, 1), etc„ and appears rather to be
eausal, as equivalent to ‘ ob tristitiam2’
see Introd. v. § 30.

neuter plural adjectives in the genit. (as
2. 53, 2, ete), dat. (as 4. 31, 1; 59, 4,
etc.), and abl.·(as 4. 3, 45 58, 3, etc.).

revolvo, se. animo: cp. 4. 21, 2;
Agr. 46, 3. This use appears to be
adopted from Vergil (Aen. 2, 101) and.
Ovid (Fast. 4, 667).

ludibria rerum mortalium. ‘ The
mockery pervading human affairsz' cp.
‘ Fortunae ludibria’ (Cic. Parad. 1. 1, 9);
‘ludibria casus‘ (Liv. 30. 30, 5). On
the satalism of Tacitus, see Introd. iv.

p. 21.

17. auctor senatui fuit. Most of the >

priestly colleges were filled up formerly
by popular election out of a list sumished
by the ‘collegium.’ These elections had
now, like those of the magistrates, passed
to the senate; and we gather from this
passage that the princeps, besides, of

course, having his right of nomination as ν

a member of the college, had also the
right of ‘ commendatio’ (Introd. vi. p. 79).
See the speech of Claudius (Tab. Lugd.
ii. 13, in App. to Book xi.) ; Plin. Epp.
4. 8, 3; 10. 133 and other authorities

cited by Mommsen (Staatsr. ii. p. 1055). >

These persons (on whom see c. 13, 3)
were probably elected ‘supra numerum’
(cp. 1. 54. 2); and it is stated by Dio
(51. 20, 3), that such elections had be-
come so frequent that the colleges con-
sisted practically of uo fixed number. .
