in the time of Claudius (11. 4, 2, ete.).
Another expulsion is recorded in the
time of Nero (13. 25, 4).

1. Idem annus . . . adficit, repeated
in 6. 45, 1 : cp. Introd. v. ξ 75.

alterum ex geminis: see on 2, 84, 1.
The child was about four years old.

3. Lucilius Longus. An incidental
notice in Kal. Amitern. (Orell. Insc. ii.
p. 397) shows that Longus was COS. suff.
with Creticus Silanus (cp. 2.43‚ 3) in 760,
A.1). 7.

4. unusque e senatoribus, ‘the only
senator.’ Two knights, who also ac-
companied Tiberius to Rhodes, are men-
tioned in 6. 10, 2.

5. censorium funus.. The expression
is repeated in 6. 27, 2; 13. 2, 6; H. 4.
47, 2. As public funerals were under-
taken by contract (cp. on 3.4S, 1), and eon-
tracts in the name of the state were in re-
publican times usually let by the censors,
it is generally thought that, though cen-
sors had ceased to exist, ‘ censorium
funus ’ is still a synonym for ‘ funus publi·
cum‚' the one expression (in 6. 11, 7)
being apparently equivalent to the other
(in 6. 27, 2). It has also been taken to
mean a public funeral of the highest kind,
such as would have been given to one
who had filled the censorship, the highest
magistracy. In this sense, the term could
be used properly of the funeral of Claudius
(13. 2, 6), who really had been censor.

forum Augusti, one of the series
of imperial Fora north east of the old
Forum, between the Capitol and Quirinal.
In its centre was the Temple of Mars
Ultor (cp. 2. 64, 2), and many statues of
great men stood in its porticoes (Suet.
Aug. 31). Respecting its site and re-
mains, see Burn, Rome, etc. p. 131.

6. etiam tum. A contrast is implied
to the later prevalence of private trials
(cp. 6. 10, ²3 11. 2, 1, etc), and is illus-.
trated by the extreme case of bringing a
charge against Caesar's own procurator
before the senate. That such persons
were usually tried before the princepss
would appear from 13. 33, 1 ; Dial. 7, ι.

7. procurator: see note on e. 6, 53¹ ¹
2. 47, 3, etc. The existence of these fisca& ’
officers, even in all senatorial provinces is. '
attested by numerous inscriptions (sed
Marquardt, Staatsv. i. p. 414); but the.
context shows that their position was fat
lower at present in these than in the.
Caesarian provinces, and wholly different—5
from that of p··ocurat0rs who were aetuah
governors: see Introd. vii. p. 522. {3

8. causam dixerit, sc. ‘apud 805.Ἑῇ “
supplied from ‘apud quos.' 3}

9. servitia. The force of ‘ familiaresfii
extends also to this word ; the ‘ pecuniae ’¹3 γ
are the αὐτοκρατορικὰ χρήματα of Dio (5
2 3, 5), who states that procurators
then only prosecute their elaims befo‘g
the ordinary courts. An extension ’,ᾗ s
g1ven to their jurisdiction under Claudis
(see on 12. 60, 1), and they become quigf
independent of the proconsul: cp. Dig. J
16, 9 ‘si fiscalis pecuniaria causa siff-5.
quae ad procuratorem principis respici ἢ,
melius fecerit (proconsul) si abstineat.'

10.. praetoris, ‘of a governorz’ u ›rlz
here as a general term (cp. note on 1. 7 ’ξ ·
1), though the proconsul of this ρωνιίιις-’Ϊ> =
was always of consular rank. , —. J
