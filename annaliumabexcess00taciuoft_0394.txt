the devout Paulla as ‘Gracchorum stirps,

have been fifteen years, and that the
suboles Scipionum, Paulli heres’ (see

words here may be a Corruption of ‘post

Gibbon, c. 31, note 11).

L. Sulla. et Cn. Pompeius proavi.
Faustus Cornelius Sulla, son of the dic-
tator, had married the daughter of Cn.
Pompeius Magnus (cp. Bell. Afr. 95, 2).
Their daughter Cornelia was mother of
Lepida by Q. Aemilius Lepidus, cos. 773,
B.C. 21 (Dio, 54. 6, 33 Hor. Ep. 1. 20,
28), whose relationship to the main stem
of the Lepidi is uncertain.

1. defertur. On the inf. with this
verb, cp. 2. 27, 1.

2. P. Quirinio: see c. 48; 2. 30, 4.

3. quaesitumque, etc. On the Chal-
daean astrologers, see 2. 27, 2. To consult
them against (or concerning) the imperial
family or on the future of the state was
made a capital offence‚ as any sinister
prediction was an encouragement to con-
spiracies. For similar charges, cp. 12.
22, 1 ; 16. 30, 2. It was still a capital
offence at the time of the jurists, as was
also, sor similar reasons, the enquiry by a
slave touching the horoscope of his
master: see the authorities cited in Mar-
quardt‚ Staatsv. iii. p. 91, 92.

4. Manio Lepido: see note on c. 32,
23 1. 13, 2.

post. dictum repudium, ‘after de-
claration of divorce ; ’ the usual phrase is
‘mittere repudium.' The vindictiveness
of Quirinius appears to be shown not so
much by the prosecution being merely
aster a divorce, as by its being many
years after it. The statement of Suetonius
(Tib. 49) that twenty years had inter-
vened, seems exaggerated; as Quirinius
ean hardly have married her till aster the
death of L. Caesar in 755, A.D. 2 (cp. c. 2 3,
1) ς but Nipp. thinks that the interval may

quintum decimum repudi annum.’ During
the interval she had married Mamercus
Scaurus: see c. 23, 3.

6. dispexerit, potential subjunct. (In-
trod. v. § 51).

7. yenit, sc. ‘inter se,' ‘showed by
turns.

8. maiestatis erimina, i.e. the charge
of consulting astrologers respecting his
house. Her juvenile betrothal to Lucius
Caesar might possibly have strained the
charge of adultery into one of treason
(cp. 2. 50, 1).

9. M. Servilium: see 2. 48, 1.

10. quae velut reicere voluerat, ‘what
he had apparently desired to exclude from
the case.’ ⁴ Reicere? which had been cor-
rected to ‘ reticere ² and ‘reticeri‚' has got
back into most texts, except that ofNipp.,
who reads ‘ nescire.' We should certainly
have rather expected ‘velut reiecerat ’ or
‘velut reici voluerat; ¹ but no alteration
'appears to be really necessary (for further
discussion, see Pfitzner, p. 160, 165 ; Joh.
Miiller, Beit. 3. p. 31). On the use of
‘velut,’ see 1. 8, 7. Tiberius had not pro-
hibited, nor, as it seemed, sincerely de-
precated the charge.

11. militari custodia: cp.14. 60, 5;
H. 4. 11, 4. This custody would be that
of the praetoriam, who, though not yet
collected into their camp (4. 2, 1), must
have had some barraek prison (cp. 1. 21, 2)
in Rome. The change from this to the
custody of the consuls, who were now
civil magistrates only, would hardly, in
the case of slaves detained for torture,
arise from a desire to be lenient to them,
but would be significant of Caesar's wish
to exercise no influence in the trial.
