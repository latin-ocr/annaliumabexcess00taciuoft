[ulia was just born ς and early in 716, 13.c. 38, took place the marriage
nith Livia, which, though contracted under scandalous circumstances,
·esulted at least in a lasting attachment. Scribonia is ·styled in in-
aen'ptions ‘ Scribonia Caesaris ' (Orell. 612, Henzen 5362). She lived to
lhare voluntarily the exile of her daughter in 752, nc. 2 (Vell. 2. 100, 5).

4. Agrippa inscribes himself on the Pantheon, ιΜ. Agrippa L. F.,’

›mitting, as he usually did, his ignoble gentile name. He obtained
hree consulships‚ of which two were consecutive (see 1. 3, 1), and
he honour, said to be unprecedented, of the ‘corona classica' (Vell. 2.
31, 2). He was also the first ever admitted to share the tribunitian
›ower of the princeps (see 3. 56, 3). He was first married, probably
11 718, B. c. 36, to Pomponia, daughter of T. Pomponius Atticus the
'riend of Cicero, by whom he had Vispania Agrippina, married to Ti..
:laudius Nero (see B, note 2). Pomponia, if still alive, must have been
livorced when he married Marcella in 726, B.c. 28 (Dio, 53. 1, 2), who
ιι her turn was given up in 733, B.c. 21, to enable him to marry Julia
Dio, 54· 6, 5)-
, 5. Α (5). Julia was married at the age of fourteen to Marcellus, in 729,
xc. 25, and four years later to Agrippa, who was of the same age as
zer father. On other projected marriages for her, see note on 4. 40, 8 ;

6. A (6). On Gaius Caesar and Lucius Caesar, see 1. 3, etc. Their
»onours and titles are gathered from Mon. Anc. (ii. 46, etc.)‚ and from
leveral inscriptions (Orell. 633—644). Gaius was pontifeX, augur, consul
354, ΑΛ). 1), princeps iuventutis, and imperator, apparently for the capture
>f Artagira (Henzen, p. 60).ν Lucius was augur, cos. design. and princeps
uventutis. The betrothal of Lepida to him is mentioned in 3. 23, 1.
k long inscription is preserved recording the honours paid to the
§emory of both princes by the magistrates and citizens of the ‘ colonia
[Ulia Pisana’ (Pisae in Etruria), of which they were patrons (Orell. 642,
5⁴32. The dates of their deaths are from Insc. Orell. 644.

ἓ ’7. A (8). On the younger Julia, her exile and her death, see 3. 24, 5, ·
11716; Suet. Aug. 64, 65. Her husband was son of the censor Paullus
lud Cornelia, and thus grandson of Scribonia (see note 3). Her son,
δίζ- Lepidus, a man of most profligate character, was put to death by
Riius, who had previously given him Drusilla in marriage, and medi-
Qd designating him as his successor. See note on 14. 2, 4, Dio,
