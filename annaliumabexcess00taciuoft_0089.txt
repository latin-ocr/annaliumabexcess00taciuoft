CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLV PRINCIPATE. 71

still remains of the ‘ lex de imperio Vespasiani ¹,’ which, though appar-
ently conveying in form the tribunitian power, specifies far more preroga-
tives than belong to the conception of that office, and must either be
taken to show an almost indefinite extension of its idea ², or to include

other powers vested in the princeps. That this power would of itself
give full right to convoke and consult the senate, as well as to control³
its decisions, is matter of course: we find also that the princeps could
dispense with legal formalities in summoning it ⁴, and could, when absent,
bring before it in writing a certain number of motions, which took prece-
dence of all others⁵ ; and when Caesar in person put the question, the
magistrates so far became ‘ privati ’ as to be asked their ‘ sententia ⁶ ; '
while he himselfeither guided their decision by speaking first, or reserved
¹ himself to the end ⁷, so as either by formal veto ⁸ or less formal modifica-
’ tion⁹ to amend the proposals of others. It appears also that the ‘ius
auxilii, ad tuendam plebem,' and general coercive power even originally
, extended a mile beyond the pomoerium ¹⁰, and must ultimately have been
unrestricted by any limit of distance ¹¹. We can thus readily understand
.· the description by Tacitus of this power as ‘ a title of supremacy devised
γ by Augustus, to make him pre-eminent over all other authorities, without
L assuming the name of king or dictator ¹203
” ΙΙΙ. The remaining magisterial functions are chiefly censogjal or
consular-censorial¹³. The censorship itself fell into abeyance from
730, B.c. 24, till it was assumed temporarily by Claudius ¹⁴, and for life
by Domitian ¹⁵. But Augustus, besides permanently assuming the

 

of his consulship, and twice (746 and 767, iac. 8, A.D. 14) of an ‘im- “

perium consulare ¹⁷‚’ to hold a ‘ census populi,' with which, on each

occasion, a formal ‘lectio senatus ' appears to have been joined ¹⁸: he also,
