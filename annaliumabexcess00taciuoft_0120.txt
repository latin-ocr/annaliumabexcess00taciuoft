102 · INTRODUCTION.

by the exactions osa subordinate officer¹; and the chief Gaulish tribes
driven to the same course by a load of debt²‚ probably not uncon-
nected with ruinous requisitions for the wars of Germanicus³: Pontius
Pilate was allowed ten years of misgovernment in Judaea4: and fuller
records from the provinces themselves would probably have shown
many other such blots on the administration, under even one of the
most srugal and vigilant of the Caesars.

With the provinces should be enumerated the semi-independent states
and kingdoms, whose position must have varied greatly. Some were
small free states, as Samos ⁵, Rhodes ⁶, Lycia⁷; analogous to the many
free cities within the provinces. In others the prince had the title of
‘praefectus' (as Cottius⁸), or the position in fact (as Herod and his
sons) of a procurator⁹; or may have been under a similar control ‘to
that exercised over the Thracian princes ¹⁰. Juba and his sons in
Mauretania¹¹, and the princes left in Cilicia¹2‚ may have been free
from other obligations than to furnish troops on demand ¹³. The Cap-
padocian king was even liable to be brought before the bar of the
senate ¹⁴. The relation of Commagene is unknown ¹⁵. Beyond this
the Armenian kingdom and the smaller Caspian principalities¹⁶ seem
to have accepted a kind of Roman suzerainty as their best protection
against Parthia. ‘²

Many of these were subsequently incorporated into the empire ¹⁷3
but the conquest of Britain is the principal departure, prior to Trajan,
from the cautious advice of Augustus. ¹⁸ The campaigns of Germanicus
did but avenge the fate of Varus, and secure the frontier by spreadingg
terror beyond: though visions may have passed before his own mind
of a frontier on the Elbe¹²³3 which he never really reached ²⁰, and which ’
fades more and more out of Roman knowledge ²¹.
