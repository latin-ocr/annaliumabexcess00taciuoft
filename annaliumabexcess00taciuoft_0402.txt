1. tertium consul. In 702, B.C. 52,
Pompeius was created consul ‘absens et
solus, quod nulli alii umquam contigit'
(Liv. Epit. B. 107). He was appointed
‘corrigendis moribus‚’ i.e. to stop the
violence prevalent at recent elections.
He retained the proconsulate of Spain
with this virtual dictatorship, which from
the first of August became an ordinary
consulship, by being shared with Q. Me
tellus Scipio. On the history of the year,
see Mommsen, Hist. Β. ν. ch. 83 Watson,

ii (where full references to authorities are

g 2. >gravior remediis etc.; by hiffie-
vere and retrospective laws ‘ de vi' ‘'nd
‘de ambitu3’ by the trials held under
them; by his military rule in Rome; by
overawing the court on the trial of Milo
by presence of a guard (see references
above). Tacitus, who elsewhere calls
Pompeius ‘oeculti0r, non melior' (sc.
‘Mario et Sulla '), had formed a very
different estimate of him from Livy (see
below, 4. 34, 4); but appears to show no
real perception of the magnitude of the
evils which had then to be dealt with:
see Merivale‚ ch. xiii. p. 4⁶·

3. auctor . . . subversor. In viola·
tion of his own laws against riot and cor-
ruption, he sent into court a written com—
mendation in favour of Plancus Bursa,
and prevented the conviction of his
father-in-law Scipio. Also, in violation
of his law ‘ de iure magistratuum,' which
provided that candidates should canvass
in person, and that five years should in-
tervene between the tenure of office at
Rome and the government of a province ;
he secured for himself for another five
years the government of Spain, and was
a party to the dispensation from personal
canvass given to Caesar. See the autho-
rities referred to in Watson, 1. l.

quae armis tuebatur. This refers
not only to his military rule during his
consulship (see above), but also to his
position afterwards with ‘proconsulare
imperium' outside the gates of Rome

(Caes. B. G. 6. 1, ι), and to the troops Ῐ
held in his name by his legati in Spain 3
(Id. B. C. 1. 85, 8; Vell. 2. 48, 1). Ἰ
4. per viginti annos, from Phar· ζ
salia to the sixth consulship of Augustus, ζ’-
706-726, B.c. 48-28. It is indeed as· {¹
tonishing, that Tacitus should regard the
dictatorship of Caesar as merely part of 2
this general anarchy, and that in a review ζ
of Roman legislation his ‘Leges Iuliae’ j>
should be altogether ignored. For an ξιζ
account of them, see Watson, Part iv. 92·ss
Appendix ix. That the ‚triumvirate should ‘⁴
be also thus dealt with is not remarkable, ’ {j
owing to the general cancelling of its ,ζῆ
