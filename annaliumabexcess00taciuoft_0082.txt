forth always assumed by Octavianus, his proper praenomen and gentile
name drop out of sight, and he becomes ‘ Imp. Caesar. iii vir R.P.C.¹.' ’
From this must be distinguished the ‘ nomen imperatoris,' which also

he now began to assume as a permanent title. This was given, as in
old times, by acclamation on the field of battle²‚ and was received by'
Augustus twenty· one times in his life³, for victories gained in person v2>
or through lieutenants⁴ ; of which he had already numbered seven in ’Ξ
725,13..c 29⁶. ᾗ

Α15ο it appears that, in some form, he had received in 718, 13..c 36, ἰ
a tribunitian powerss. Whether we take the authority followed by
Appian and repeated by Orosius, stating that he was in that year
chosen' tribune for life⁷,· or that followed by Dio, according to which ’ἓ
the sacrosanctity and seat of a tribune were decreed to him in this
year, and the power itself 1n 724,13..c 30⁸3 he will in either case have ff
held it before 731, nc. 23, from which date the years of its tenure as l
a title are numbered ⁹ f

By the end of the second‘ quinquennium‚' at the close of 721, Β.ο. 33, ““
Lepidus had been deposed, and war with Antonius was imminent. ³
Hence, though Antonius appears to have styled himself ‘triumvir’ till ³
his death ¹⁰, Caesar limits the formal term of that office to the ten years 11;
and now claims a power quasi-dictatorial‚ or a virtual concentration of
the whole triumvirate in himsesfi'not, apparently, by formal vote, but by
general consent. ‘Iuravit in mea verba tota Italia sponte sua, et me
b[ello] quo vici ad Actium, ducem depoposcit ¹2? ‘ Per consensum uni-
versorum [potitus rerum omn]iu1n' (ἐγκ[ρατ]ὴς γενόμενος πάντων τῶν πραγ-
μάτων) ¹³.

Also, after a short second consulship in 721, B.c. 33, he enters on
a continuous series of nine consulships, his third to his eleventh,

 

. 723—731, B.c. 31-23.

The following inscription of the year 725, 13.c. 29, shows the titles
which he then bore, but makes no mention‘ of the tribunitian power :—-
‘ Imp. Caesari. Divi Juli f. cos. quinct. cos. design. sext. imp. septu)
