CORNELII TACJTI ANNALIUM [A. U.C. 767.

enimvero militiam ipsam gravem, influe-o

tuosam: denis in diem assibus animam et eorpus aestimari:
hinc vestem arma tentoria, hinc saevitiam centurionum et vaca-

tiones munerum redimi. v'at hercule verbera et vulnera, duram ’1

5 hiemem, exercitas aestates, bellum atrox aut sterilem pacem

sempiterna.

nec aliud levamentum quam si certis sub legibuss

militia iniretur, ut singulos denarios mererent, sextus decumus
stipendii annus finem adferret, ne ultra sub vexillis tenerentur,

set isdem in castris praemium pecunia solveretur.

references in Marquardt, Staatsv. i. p.
453) had been discontinued, and an as-
signment of land substituted.

1. enimvero, used, like ἀλλὰ μήν, to
anticipate an objection, such as, that sol-
diers might save out os their pay.

2. denis in diem assibus: see below,
on ‘singulos denarios.'

3. hino vestem, etc. The enactment
stated (Plut. C. Gracch. 5, 837) to have
been procured by Gracchus, providing
the soldier with clothing at the public
eost, must have become obsolete; while
the later enactments providing for their
arms and equipment (see Marquardt,
Staatsv. ii. p. 94) had not yet corne into
torce. From the absence of any allusion
to food, it appears that they received
rations of corn besides their pay, a pri-
vilege not granted to the praetorians till
the time of Nero (see 15. 72, 13 Suet.
Ner. πο).

saevitiam centurionum et vaca.-
tiones munerum: both expressions de-
note the same practice. If centurions
knew that a soldier had money to spare,
they laid additional tasks on him to
make him purchase surlough or exemp-
tion. A full description of this system,
and of the demoralisation resulting from

. it, is given in H. 1. 86.

4. redimi. This verb can be used,
in different senses, as well with ‘saevi-
tiam’ as with ‘vacationes ;’ having often
the meaning of ‘buying off ’ what is un-
pleasant, as well as of ‘ buying’ what is
desirable. It would not however be used
with equal propriety of the stoppages sor
necessaries, such as clothes, etc. ; so that
for these the sense of the simple verb
‘emi’ appears to be supplied from its
compound, as ‘ petivere' from the follow-
ing ‘repetivere' in 15. 11. 2.

hercule. This points the contrast
between scanty pay and abundant hard-
ships.

5. exercitas, ‘spent in toil:’ cp. ‘aes-
tatem inquietam exercitamque' Pl. Epp.

7. 2, 2. So Tacitus has ‘exercita militia ' ,

c. 35, 2.

6. certis . . . legibus, ‘fixed conditions,'
as opposed to the illusory rules by which
their discharge was now delayed.

7. singulos denarios. Pliny, in his
account (N. H. 33. 3, 13, 45) of the low·
32⁸5?ssss civilss‘ssssssffnt‘iaeffi· {2¹} ‚thgegssg
only ἡ of the ‘denarius,' adds ‘in militari
tamen stipendio semper denarius pro de-
cem assibus datus3’ which may be ex-
plained to mean that the soldiers received
the same fraction of the ‘denarius' as
before. At that time their pay is reck-
oned by Polybius (6. 3'9, 12) at two obols
or ᾖ of the ‘ denarius ‘ :531- of the reduced
‘ asses.’ It would appear that subse-
quently, when the pay was nominally
doubled by Julius Caesar (Suet. Jul. 26),
it was really raised, not to 103, but only
to 10 ‘asses,’ and that the account given
by Pliny is so far untrue. But they now
demand, not merely this extra fraction,
but the full ‘denarius‚' alleging that the
praetorians, whose pay waS, by regula-
tion, only the double of theirs (Dio, 53.
1 1, 5), received actually two full ‘ denadi:
= 3² ⁸ asses.' For further information, see

Marquardt, Staatsv. ii. pp. 92-94. It has
been thought that we have here the ex- »
aggeration of the speaker, and that the ’

pay of the praetorians cannot really have
been so much greater. It is certainly
observable that this grievance is through-
out less prominent than that of the de-
layed discharge (see c. 19, 4, etc.), and
that the concessions offered even in the

extreme crisis (c. 36, 4) contain no al· .

lusion to it.

earlier· regulation of Augustus (Dio, 54. ⁴
