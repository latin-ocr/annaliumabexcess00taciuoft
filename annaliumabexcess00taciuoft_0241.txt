punishment was deferred till the expira-

5. vita. This is usually taken as an
abl. and would be a similar modal abl. to
‘constantia' Mr. F rost takes it as the
subject of the verb.

6. 1.. Asprenate. Probably this was

11. sodales Titios. This old religious
brotherhood is mentioned by Luoen
(1, 602), Suetonius (Galb. 8), and in
many inscriptions, e. g. Orell. 746, 890,
2364, 2365, 2366, etc. Tacitus else-
where (H. 2. 95, 3) ascribes the founda-
tion to Romulus in honour of Tatius;
which is more likely to have been the
received form of the legend, inasmuch
as Tatius, who (see Liv. ι. 10—14) is
really known only as the eponymus os
this priesthood and of the old century or
tribe of the Titienses, was certainly
honoured by sacrifices (Dion. Hal. 2. 52),
and may be a god ‘ Euhemerized‘ into a
man. See Seeley, Hist. Exam. of Livy,
b. 1. pp. 37, 73, etc. Nothing is known
of the functions of this priesthood; but
Varro (L. L. 5, 85), in connecting their
name with ¹ aves Titii,' appears to asso-
ciate them with the seience of augury.
T acitus here supposes them to have kept
up the Sabine religion. See Marquardt,
Staatsv. iii. p. 4² 7.

sorte ducti, etc. In Suet. Galb. 8,
we find evidence of subsequent elections
by cooptation, but the general mode of
election is not known. On ‘primores
civitates,' see note on c. 24, 1.

13. adiciuntur3 i. e. as supernumerary
or honorary members. Such were not
unfrequently added by senatorial election
(see on 3. 19, 1). The addition of
Claudius is remarkable, as he was not
included in the Julian family. On the
distinct office of ‘ flamen Augusti‚’ see on
c. 10, 5, 8.
