Druso fratre Tiberii genitus, Augustae nepos, set anxius occul-

humour. The legion views itself as one
body, and treats each centurion as having
chastised the whole; for which his body
has to suffer retribution from sixty chas-
tisers. Is this view is right, no inference
can be drawn as to the number of soldiers
in a century.

1. convulsos laniatosque. ‘ with
limbs dislocated and man led.' Tlffis
Lueretius has ‘artfissssseofivfss‘i' (3. 343),
and M. Seneca ‘convolsis laceratisque
membris,’ of persons racked (Contr. 2.
13, 6). This seems better than Nipp’s
explanation, ‘plucked from the ground:
like ‘vexilla convellunt’ (c. 2ο, 1).

2. Septimius . . . Cassius Chaerea.
It is implied that both these were centu-
rions. The former is otherwise unknown;
Chaerea was in 794, A.D. 41, a tribune
in the praetorian guard, and, if rightly
then called ⁶ elderly’ (Suet. Cal. 56), can
hardly have been now very young.

6. animi ferox. See Introd. v. § 33
e γ. With this particular word such a
’ genitive appears elsewhere to be found
gnlgr in 4. 12, 35 H. 1. 35, 23 Ov. Met.

et armatos. This adds force to
‘obstantes‚’=‘et quidem armatos.' Cp.
‘vetera et inania' 3. 13, 2, ete.

7. vigilias . . . stationes. Cp. c.
28, 5.

9. altius coniectantibus, ‘to more
penetrating judges of the soldiessffs‘ffi-
meten} On this concise force of altius,

cpj‘altius . . . maerebant' (2. 82, 5), ‘altius
disseram’ (3. 25, 3), ‘altius expediam’
(Η. 4. 12, 1), etc, and sor ‘coniectare
aliquem,' in the sense of ⁶ estimating,’ cp.
‘ ne ceteri ex Paeligno coniectarentur ¹
(12. , 3).

ιοᾷἳίἰείεοιίέ sparsi,' as c. 61, 33 3. 2,
53 4. 46, 3, etc. “Ns

11. aut. The MS. text ‘nil,’ has been
generally assumed to be corrupt; but the
various alterations to ‘nec,' ‘neque,' ‘vell
or ⁴ aut,' seem hardly felicitous. It is pos-
sible that some other word, with · neque,'
has dropped out before ‘neque disiecti‚‘
or that an erroneous transposition of ‘nil’
and ‘ neque,' like that of ‘ ad se nisi' (c.
26, 5), has taken place (ep. Pfitzner,‚p.
144, 176); in either of which cases ‘nil'
might stand. with a verb such as ‘age-
rent’ supplied from the context (see
Introd. v. ξ 38 b).

pariter, ‘as one man.’ This word
often has the force of ‘ simul,' as e. 47, 3,
etc.

ardescerent. On the frequent po-
etieai use in Tacitus of simple verbs for
their compounds‚ see Introd. v. 5 4ο.

12. aequalitate, ‘uniformity.' This
use occurs in Cic., etc.; but with Tacitus

the word is more commonly equivalent to ἦ

ἰσοτιμία, as c. 4, 1, etc.
13. oeneus accipienti: see on c. 31, 2.

14. neptem. On the dement, family
connexions‚ and children of Germanicus ,

and Agrippina, see Introd. ix.
