habiti, ‘were considered to be next
in suffering and treated as next in their
relies? The zeugma may be compared
with that in c. 44, 3.

1. 'Pemnioa etc. These are mostly
small cities. Temnos, Aegeae, Myrina,
and Cyme, had formed part of the old
Aeolie confederation (Hdt. 1. 149, 1);
the remainder are in Lydia: of these
Philadelphia alone is well known, and
{toplcll on the site now occupied by Al-
as er.

2. aut Macedones Hyrcani3 so called
also in Pl. N. H. 5. 29, 31, 120. This
town, inhabited by an older race of Hyr-
cano-Persians, who had given their name
to the ‘ Hyrcanian plain’ (Strab. 13. 4, 13,
629), mixed with Macedonian settlers, is
not the same with, though near to, Mos-
teni. The use of ⁶ aut' might no doubt
be explained as in the sentence a few lines
above, but the word is at least misleading.
Nipp., with Freinsh., reads ⁴ et qui.' The
change from names of people to those of
places is merely for the sake of variety:
cp. c. 60, 4, etc.

4. refoveret ; a word chiefly post-Au-
gustan, frequent in Tacitus, as c. 54, 2, etc.

5. Ateius. This name is adopted by
Halm and Nipp., from Mommsen, and
⁴ Aietius ' by Orelli, sor the MS. ‘ Aletus,'
which is no Roman name. We find from
Dio (57. 17, 7) that he had the five fasces
which would mark his position as tem-
porarily that of a ‘legatus Augusti pro-
praetore:' see Mommsen, Staatsr. ii.
p. 1037. On the consular proeonsuls of

Introd. vii. pp. 95, 97.

7. in publicum. This depends on
‘ magnificam, ’ and is similarly used with
‘exitiosi ’ and ‘laetum ’ (11. 17, 4; 12. 3,
3): cp. ‘laeta in rempublicam' 11. 25,
43 and note on 1. 76, 5 ; also ‘petita in
fiscum ' here.

auxit, ‘ enhanced.'

8. liberalitate: see note on c. 37, 2.

Aemiliae Musae. Doed. notes that
she was probably a freed-woman (as
Antonius Musa the physician ofAugustus
appears to have been a freedman), and
that the family of her patronus was not
clearly traceable‚ whence het property
was claimed as an escheat, by the ‘pro-
curatores hereditatum ² appointed for that
purpose (see Orelli's note).
⁶ videbatur ' below implies that the proof
was not plain.

9. Aemilio Lepido 3 evidently the
same M. Lepidus, who is called ‘inops ’ (3.

32, 2) and ¹ pecuniae modicus‘ (3. 72, 3). ³

10. Patulei. This name, or ‘Pantu-

leius‚' is found with the cognomen ‘Parra ’ ’

in Varr. R. R. 3, 5,-and with that of ‘ Grap-

tiacus' and ‘Anatellon’ in later inscrip- '3

tions (Grut. 126, 895; C. Ι. L. iii. 2,
6121). Nipp. It is possible that a prae·

nomen is lost, as Tacitus generally, in a fx.
single mention of persons of rank. gives ᾗ

more than one name.

11. in parte, ⁴ to half the property.’ ξ
Later, such legacies to the princeps were ⁴ '
frequently given to save the rest (cp. 14. ξ
31, 13 16. 11, 23 Agr. 43, 45 Plin. Pan. ν
43), and even insisted on (cp. Suet. Cal. f ι

38; Ner. 32).
