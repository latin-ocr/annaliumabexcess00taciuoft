32 INTRODUCTIOIV.

    

natural gists, not unmixed with the natural defects, of the most finishe
pleader of an age which required above all that its orators should be
terse, brilliant, and striking.

Historical style was all the more likely to be rhetorical, owing to the
custom of oralrecitation. From many instances in which the effec· Ξ
”’ on the ear seems to be studied‚ and others in which oral emphasis ³
would have removed an ambiguity‚ it is not improbable that Tacitus
may havevadopted this general practice.

To these should be added the most truly personal of all his traits
of style, thefelevation and dignity (σεμνότης) known to have characterised
the orator ¹, and which, in the relation not only of great matters, butv
also of what is trivial, or even revolting‚ appears never to be lost sight'
of by the historiari.

The following instances are almost wholly restricted to the Anna1s‚ ,
not only on account of the limits of the present treatise‚ but also 7³
because these are the most truly Tacitean of all the writings of Tacitus; ᾗῇ
many uses and expressions, rare or even unknown in his earlier works, l
being in them frequent and even habitual’.

The arrangement of Dr‘ager, whose sections are cited throughout ³
is far more elaborate and scientific than that here given, which has Ξ
been simplified for convenience of general reference. It will be evident ι’
that many obligations are also due throughout to the Grammars of ⁴

Zumpt, Madvig, Kennedy, and Roby, especially the last.
