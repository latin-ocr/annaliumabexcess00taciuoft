quod imperator sola militis commoda ad senatum reh‘iat. eundem 6

ergo senatum consulendum, quotiens supplicia aut proelia indi- ι
cantur: an praemia subxdoffiinis poenas sine arbitro esse?v

which appears to be its meaning in c. 46,

2, etc. Here, however, the only question

thus reserved by Drusus is whether certain

concessions should be made or not (c. 26,
“ 5). The suggestion below (c. 26, 6),

that if the senate be consulted on military
rewards it should also be consulted on
punishments, is thrown out by the soldiers
themselves, to show that they saw through
the pretext.

4. arbitrium . . . obtenderet, ‘was
pleading the authority? i. e. that they
musT''‘'decide o'r'i‘*⁸such requestS. ‘ Ob-
tendere ’ is often thus used by Tacitus, as
also by Quint. and Pl. min„ in speaking
of a plea or pretext, e- g. 3. 17, 2; 35,
2, etc.: cp. the substantive ‘obtentui'
(c. 10, 1, etc.). «

6. augendis On this gerundive dative,
see Introd. v. fi 22 b.

8. cunetis, a rhetorical exaggeration.
Even the centurion had his vine-rod (see
c. 23, 4); but capital punishment could
be inflicted on a soldier. in Caesarian
provinces, by no lower officer than the
‘legatus Augusti ; ' in senatorial pro-
vinces, not even by the proconsul. See
Dio, 53. 13, 6.

9. rettulisse, ‘had repeatedz’ cp. 4.
4, 3; also ‘veterem Valeriae gentis . . .
laudern rettulisset’ (Cic. Flaec. 1, 1);
¹ cum aditus consul idem illud responsum
rettulit ’ (Liv. 37. 6, 7); ‘ nota refert
meretricis acumina' (Hor. Epp. 1. 17. 5 5).

numquamne ad se nisi. Nearly
all editors have followed Lipsius in thus
transposing the MS. text ‘numquamne
nisi ad se:’ so also ‘adversum ferri’
(c. 65, 7) has been treated as an error of

χ

transposition. This general agreement
makes it needless to examine Walther’s
explanation of the words as they stand in
the MS„ as an exaggeration put into the
mouth of the speaker, making the griev<
ance peculiar to themselves.

10. fflios familiarum, i e. persons not
‘ sui iuris) The incompetence to redress a
military grievance has no real connection
with the disabilities of a ‘ filius-familias ;¹
which may be illustrated by the account
of Tiberius after his adoption (Suet.
Tib. 15), ‘neque donavit neque manu·
misit, ne hereditatem quidem aut legata
percepit aliter, quam ut peculio referret
accepta? The word is thus contemptuous
rather than relevant, and merely means,
⁶ Are our rulers never themselves to
visit us ²? ’

novum id plane. The main stress
is laid upon ‘commoda ς’ but ‘ militis ’ is
also emphatic in relation to ‘ imperator!
That the senate could in no way interfere
with military matters not specially re-
ferred to it, is plain from 6. 3, 1; and
such reference to it here, as in c. 6, 5,
appears to be an evasive devolution of
responsibility. On the practice of Tibe-
rius, see note on c. 52, 2.

13. sub dominis; this is used in-
vidiously‚ ‘under ‚dsssspofismff Augustus
and Tiberius alike repudiate the ‘title of ‚
‘dominus' as an insult. See 2. 87 2 ·”
Suet. Aug. 533 Tib. 27. ss‘·-“*¹“”'z”*‘ V* tacis»

sine arbitio r‘ holly· uncontrolled.'
The word is used ο mem->interventiom
as ‘ Armenii sine arbitro relicti sunt' 15.
