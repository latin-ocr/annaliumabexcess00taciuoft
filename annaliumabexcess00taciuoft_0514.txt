evidence as trivial (Pfitzner, p. 107). A
long list of enumerative asyndeta from
Tacitus is given here by Nipp.

1. vocentur, ‘are challenged t03' like
‘vocare in ius,' ete.

locupletiores, ‘ more trustworthy ;’
a frequent sense in Cic. with ‘ auctor’ or
⁴ testis.’

2. potentia, ‘arbitrarily;' i. e. ⁶ be-
cause he was masterz' cp. ‘qui vi et po-
testate non iure et legibus cognoscunt’
(Dial. 19. 5); where the abl. appears to
partake both of instrumental and causal
character.

, 3. Antigoni. Antigonus Doson occu-

pied Sparta after the victory of Sellasia
in Β. C. 222 (Poly b. 2. 70); Mummius had
arranged the affairs of Achaia after the
sall of Corinth' 111 608, B.c. 146.

4. permisso publice arbi4trio; rightly
explained by Nipp. to mean ‘the arbitra-
tion having been entrusted to their state'
(cp. ‘publice’ c. 36, 2). Record 0f51milar
awards is often found, and this particular
one was inscribed on the base of the statue
of Nike by Paeonios at Olympia, and is
given and explained by Mr. Hicks (Ma-
nual of Greek Inscriptions, No. 200), to
whom I arn also indebted for its date as
probably that of the consulship of Q. Cal-
purnius Piso (A. u. c. 619, B. c 135). The
awarding body was a panel of 600 dikasts;
the majority (584 to 16) being such as to
justify Mr. Hicks inference that the case
was clear, and that the subsequent 001111101-
decision (see ξ 1) was probably an in-
stance in which Antonius had traded on
the memoranda of Caesar.

Boundary stones in accordance with this

eum. Segesta (the Greek Ἐγεστα) and
mountain of Eryx were· -both' in the nor ³
west corner of Sicily; the latter being id
tified with Monte S. Giuliano near T
pani (Drepanum), and the ruins of
former traceable north- west of Calatafi
west of Alcamo. The city of Eryx on
slope of the mountain appears to havi
been deserted (Strab. 6. 2, 6, 272), pro
ably ever since its destruction by Ha· ιτ,
car Barca in the first Punic war (Di ·=
23. 93 ²4· 8), and we gather here that
territory had passed to the Segestans; ·
