life ¹ imposed even on the poorest would make many anxious to lay down
their rank ², and many outsiders of moderate means well-satisfied not ῖς
enter it ⁸. On the whole, however, such a position was the great object
of ambition, and admission to its ranks or a rise in them was sought by
fair means or foul. The base side of senatorial character is abundantly}
brought before us by Tacitus ; on the other hand, it is but fair to 'recol-

whom few are unequal to their place, and many show high qualities of
the soldier and statesman, while even so low a nature as that of L..

'regulations respecting birth as well as census ¹⁰.
