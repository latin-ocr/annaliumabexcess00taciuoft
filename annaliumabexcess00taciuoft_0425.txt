1 49. Fine anni· Clutorium Priscum equitem Romanum, post

known from Josephus (Ant. 17. 13, 53
18. 1, 1 ; 2, 1) to have held this province
in 759, A. D. 6. But these Cilician vic-
toties appear from the order of mention
to have preceded his service with Gaius
⁷ Caesar in the east; and are thus to
be assigned to his first tenure of Syria,
which Mommsen places in 751, 752,
Β. c. 3, 2.

per Ciliciam. Haupt's suggestion
' ‘super' is adopted by Nipp. and sup-

ported by Mommsen (l. 1. p. 121). The

Homonadenses were not strictly within

Cilicia, but in Pisidia‘br Isauria, though

reckoned as a Cilician race (cp. Strab. 12.

6, 5, 5693 Plin. N. Η. 5. 27, 23, 94).

Τὴε MS. text would imply, and Tacitus

may have thought, that they were spread

over parts of Cilicia itself. Mommsen
suggests, 'er appears rightly to disap-
prove of, another interpretation, by which

‘per‘ might mean ‘ passing through‚' as

‘per circum' 1. 15, 4.

> 1. Homonadensium, restored, for

the MS. ‘Onomadensium,' from Strabo

(l. 1.), who says that Quirinius starved

them into submission, and distributed
v 4000 of them as colonists in the vicinity‚

leaving none behind in the prime of life.

“ He describes them as mere cave dwellers;

but Pliny (l. l.) speaks of a town, Omana,
and sorty-four ‘ castella!

datusque rector. Mommsen (l. 1.

p: 123) dates this appointment in 755,

ΑΛ). 2, after the death of Lollius, who is

mentioned below. Gaius could then be

strictly spoken of as ‘ Armeniam optinens,’
Ἰ being actually in military possession of
that country: cp. ‘Armenios . . . optinebat’

death· of Lollius: so that Quirinius, if

γ :not ull that year sent to the east, is
hardly likely to have found him still

at Rhodes. The mutilated inscription
already referred to would make Quirinius
to have been at some time proconsul of
Asia, probably between 747-751, Β. C.
7—33 in which capacity he may have
paid to Tiberius the respect here men-
tioned.

4. M. Lollio. M. Lollius M. f. was
¹53²an ῗὲιῖὲῐέἐί {hiofiTsteoffs‘ssieissssssf
B. C. 21, legatus in Germany in 738, B.c.
16 (1. 10, 3). His antipathynto Tiberius
is mentioned by Suetonius (Tib. 12); and
his character is drawn in the blackest
colours not only, as might be expected,
by Velleius (2. 102, 1), but also by
Pliny (N. H. 9. 35, 58, 118), who states
that he committed suicide from poison
after Gaius had renounced his friendship
for his perfidy and corruption. Horace,
on the other hand, praises him highly
(Od- 4· 9, 34-44)· , ,

5. pravitatis et. discordiarum, ‘ per-
verseness and animosity3' or perhaps, as
a hendiadys, ⁶ perverse animosity.' The
same words are coupled 111 Liv. 4. 26, 6.

6. ut memoravi: see c. 22, 3.

7. praepotentem. His childlessness
(l. l.) increased his infl-uence (cp. e.
2¹, 2 . ·

³8. >(21utorium. This, the MS. text,
has been written in many editions as ‘C.
Lutorium‚' to agree with Dio (57. 20, 3),
who gives the full name Gaius Lutorius
Priscus. But it would be imusual for
Tacitus, in speaking of a somewhat ob-
scure person, to mention him in these two
chapters twice by three and twice by two
names. Ritter, who noted this, and in
his former edition omitted ‘ C’ through-
out, now follows the MS. form, which
Nipp. supports by inscriptions (Rhein.
Mus. xvi. 291), showing that ‘Clutorius’
is a Roman name. The name appears
also to occur in Pl. N. H. 7. 39, 40, 129,
where the MSS. have ‘utorio’ arrd ‘su-
torio.’
