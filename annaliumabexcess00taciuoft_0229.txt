lioenoe than that of ‘infecta sanguine
eastra, flumina,‘ etc.

precariam, ‘ on sufferance :‘ cp.
‘precaria vita’ H. 4. 76, 53 ⁶ precarium
imperium’ Η. 1. 52, 6, etc.

1. cm· enim, etc. The thought is,
‘I am living on sufferance, and it is the
fault of my short-sighted friends that Ι
ιω living at au!

2. melius, sc. ‘ fecit? On the omission
of such verbs, see Introd. v. ς 38 b.

4. tot flagitiorum . . . conscius, ‘im-
plicated with my arm in so man 'tx—uf?
tages. 1 e or its iscip ine,
he treats himself as involved in what he
had not prevented. Cp. ‘quasi scelere

cestry (as 2. 43, 63 6. 47, 3, etc.).

9. imago. This should be taken
figuratively, and ‘tui memoria’ as its
explanation, That the legions still bore
the effigy of one who had been long dead
and was not deified, is most improbable;
and the apostrophe to Augustus (‘ tua . , .
caelo recepta mens’) appeals equally to
the imagination.

10. gloria, ‘pride;’ as ‘iactantia glo-
riaque’ (c. 8, 2). Thus ‘pudor’ and
‘gloria' are joined in H. 2. 21, 6; cp.
⁸ generandi gloria mellis’ (Verg. G. 4,
²05)· Akin to this is its use in a bad
sense, as ‘ vaingloriousness’ (14. 15,
3, eto).

 

contaminaretur’ (c. 35, 4). On the con-
struction, cp. ‘ alius alii tanti facinoris
conscii’ Sall. Cat. 22, 3; ‘ si conscius
Dymno tanti sceleris fuissem' Curt. 6. 10,
πο. The construction is intended to avoid
the awkwardness of a double genitive,
and, when the dative is that of a personal
prononn, is usual.

6. sinant, ut. This construction is

,¹ found only a few times in Terence, and
³. ' once in Curtius, ‘ nec di siverint ut . . .
= ‚ qnisquam . . . possit ' (5. 8, 3).

7. ahl-itudo. W'dlfflin notes (Philol.
25, 99) that Tacitus shows a growing
preference for this more archaic form

⁹ ⁴³ (Cato, Sisenna) instead of the Cice-

rimian ⁶ claritas,’ throughout the Annals,
ἓρεοὶεῌγ in the last six books, where the

¹ s Ἰ ἢ is used always figuratively. whether of
Η personas oenown (as here, and 11. 10, 53

14. 53, 4, etc.), or of distinguished an-

hane maculam. This is by some
wrongly referred to the defeat of Varus,
of which ‘illam ' would rather have been
used. It means the stain of mutiny, and
is explained by ‘iras civiles,' as ‘ eluant‘
by ‘in exitium hostibus vertant? The
expedition in c. 49, 5, is called ‘pia-
culum surorisss and similar expressions
are used in c. 51, 7.

11. vosque. etc. The speaker is repre-
sented as skilsully imagining the existence
of the change of feeling which he desires
to produce.

12. si legatos senatui . . . redditis.
They would give him back his wife and
son by so behaving that he could safely
recall them. The figure of ‘ giving back
to the senate its delegates' seems more
farfetched, and merely to denote due
recognition of them as such; unless we
suppose him to represent them rhetori-
cally as still in the power of the legions,
aud not yet in safety.
