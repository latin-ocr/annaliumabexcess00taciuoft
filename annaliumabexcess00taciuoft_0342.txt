If it be taken to mean those of that age
in all Egypt, it may be compared with
other estimares of the population¹ on
which see Mr. Donne, in Dict. of Geog.
p. 38. Hdt. (2. 165, 166) reckons the
Egyptian force (i.e. that of its military
caste) at a maximum os about 400,000.

1. Rhamsen. Rameses ΙΙ. or Rameses
Meriamen (‘beloved of Ammon ⁹), the
great king of the nineteenth dynasty, in the
fifteenth and fourteenth centuries Β, C. The
conquests ascribed to him here and in the
monuments are those assigned to Sesos-
tris by Hdt. (2. 102) and others, includ-
ing even Strabo (15. 1, 6, 686; 17. 1, 5,
789). He is the king represented in the
great colossi at Abu-Simbel.

Libya. This, as in Hdt. and else-
where, denotes the north coast os Africa;
and ‘Aethiopia’ especially Nubia and
Abyssinia. The monuments appear to
confirm this claim of conquest as regards
these countries and Syria and Mesopo-
tamia. Hdt. (2. 102—106) follows a
tradition nearly agreeing with that here
given, and includes Thrace as well as
Scythia in the list of Egyptian conquests.
On the monumental evidence, see Rawlin-
son, Egypt, ii. p. 302, etc.

2. Medisque . . . et Bactriano. The
expressions are changed from names of
countries to names of people, plural to
singular, and again to plural, to avoid the
monotony of a long list: so ‘Samnis
Pelignus et Marsi' H. 3. 59, 2; and other
instances given in Introd. v. ξ 2; Dr.
Synt. und Stil, § 5.

4. Bithy-num . . . Lycium mare. The
former of these would appear to be taken
to mean the Euxine and Propontis, the
latter the northern part of the Levant.
The whole expression would include Asia
Minor, but not Thrace, in the conquests

of Rameses.

7. utensilium: cp. 1. 70, 6. Corn
would not here be excepted from the
term, but rather mentioned for promin-
enee.

8. vi Parthorum. This appears here
invidiously contrasted with ⁴ potentia
Romana? though ‘ vis Romana ' is used of
the Roman government in 3. 60, 6.

1 1 . Memnonis saxea effigies. One of two
sitting colossi ofAmunoph ΙΙΙ. (eighteenth
dynasty), stillremaining among the ruins of
Thebes, had been partially overthrown by
an earthquake (probably in 728, Β, C. 26) ;
and the sound proceeding at sunrise from
its remaining part is first mentioned by
Strabo (1 Z 1, 46, p. 816), and described as
ψόφος ὡς ν πληγῆς οὐ μεγαλῆς. Pausanias
(1. 42. 3) describes it as like the break-
ing of a harp-string. The Greek belief,
that the statue was that of Memnon,
appears to have arisen between the time of
Strabo and that of Pliny (N. H. 36. 7, 11,
58). A number of inscriptions, dating
A. D. 65-196, are written on the legs and
base, by persons who heard the sound:
among them by Hadrian and Sabina. See
C. I. G. 4719-4761 ; and Add. iii. p. 1200.
f011.; C. Ι. L. iii. ι, 30-66: specimens
of these are given in Wilmanns 2731-
2733; Orelli 517-5243 Henzen 5304÷
5306, 6864. From a comparison of
similar sounds heard now in the buildings
of Thebes and elsewhere, it is suggested
that these may have been due to the
effect of a sudden increase of heat on the
chilled air in erevices. The cessation of
the sounds since the restoration of the
statue (probably by Septimius Severus)
and consequent alteration of its structure,
eonfirms this. For the literature os the
subject, see Mommsen on C. 1. L. 1. 1.,
and Prof. Mayor on Juv. 15, 5.
