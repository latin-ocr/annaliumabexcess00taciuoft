1 5. Fuere qui publici funeris pompam requirerent compara-
rentque quae in Drusum patrem Germanici honora et magnifica
2Augustus fecisset. ipsum quippe asperrimo hiemis Ticinum

places seem mentioned emphatically, but
Cicero (de Or. 2, 84, 341) speaks of

, classical Latin, but both this construction
and also the use of ‘iniquus ² for ‘inimi-
cus’ (cp. 4. 68, 1: 16. 21, 3). are Cice-

ronian. The whole description is intended
no doubt as an artistic preparation sor the
narrative of inti-ignes against this family.
1. requirerent == ¹ daeiderareutss as
often in Cic„ etc. The conveyance of
the cinerary uru to the mausoleum, though
’ a public act, lacked many of the solemni—
ties of a funeral, still more of a state-
funeral (ou which see c. 48, 1, etc.) We
guther from the context that there was no
prooession of aneoetors, and no ⁶ laudatio!
3. Ticinum, now Pavia. Augustus
was in Gaul, and on hearing os the illness
of Drusus had sent off Tiberius, who
, arrived before his brother's death, and
mamhed at the head of the procession all
the way (Suet. Tib. 7 ς Dio, 55. 2).
*Rugustus met it here on his way back to
ome.
4. neque abscedentem‚etc.: cp.1. 7,6.
5. Claudiorum Iuliorumque. As
Drusus was never adopted into the latter
Lips. proposed to read ‘ Liviorum.'
t the old rule as to the ‘ ius imaginum ‘
{appears to gtavetsbecome 1855)ςῖι·ὶαὲ (ἷζε
mmsen, aar.1..427;an e
natural gradation in th? order of mention
nequires the noblest house to be put last
gap. ⁶ Claudiae et Iuliae domus partem ' 6.
, , 6); the more so as the stress is laid ou
what no doubt was one os the special
honours aecorded by Augustus to his step-
Ιοιι. Effigies, no doubt, of the Livii and
other less noble houses were borne (see
ο. 76, 4), but so eclipsed by these as not
*to need mention. Some os these Claudian
und Julian ancestors are specified in 4. 9, 3.

‘ laudationes ’ as commonly delivered ‘ in
foro.’ See the description of a Roman
funeral in Mommsen, Rom. Hist. vol. ii.
ch. 13. At that of Drusus, according to
Dio (l. 1.), the speech in the Forum was
spoken by Tiberius, and another in the
Flaminian Circus by Augustus.

7. ne solitos quidem, This is ex·
plained by what follows

9. sane, used concessively, as 1. 3, 4,
etc.

quoquo modo = ⁸ sine imaginibus et
pompa ’ (2. 73, 1). The distance is meu-
tioned to explain its not having been
brought home for buming.

10. deeora. Nipp. takes this as from
‘decorus3' as also in c. 47, 3.

11. quanto: cp. Introd. v. § 64, 2.

fratrem. Drusus and Claudius had
both gone to Tarracina (c. 2, 4). Possibly
the latter is ignored‚ as iu 2. 71, 3; as
however, in the corresponding term
‘patruus,' adoptive relationship is not
considered (cp. note on 1. 33, 3); it is
possible that ‘fratrem’ refers only to
Claudius. ‘Unius diei’ is probably an
exaggeration, as ‘Appii Forum ’ seems to
be reckoned a sair day's journey from
Rome (Hor. Sat. 1. 5, 5).

12. non . . . saltem. This use sor ‘ne
. . . quidem,’ not found elsewhere in
Tacitus, occurs in a few places in Livy
and in later prose.

13. propositam: so Halm and most
editors aster Muret.‚ as the ordinary
equivalent of the Greek προτιθέναι, and
because ‘prae' and ‘pro' are osten con-
