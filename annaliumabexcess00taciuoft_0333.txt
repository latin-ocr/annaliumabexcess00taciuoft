Orelli and others, that this means ‘other
familias of the Furian gens] can hardly
stand, as Tacitus had implied above that
the whole ‘Furium nomen' had been dur-
ing this time without military renown:
ve must therefore suppose him to have
overlooked the not very famous triumphs

Nicopolim. This city, called a
colony in 5. 10, 4, was founded by Au-
gustus, opposite to Actium, on the north
or Epirot side of the Ambracian gulf,
where his camp had stood before the bat-
tle. Here were held the revived quin-
quennial games to the Actian Apollo. See
Suet. Aug. 183 Dio, 50. 12, 3; 51. 1, 3;

attended by twelve lictors. It was usual
for the Roman magistrate, visiting a so-

priests ‘or women might have, is, in the
case of a magistrate, equivalent to none,
