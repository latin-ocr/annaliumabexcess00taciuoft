tante Pompeio Macro praetore, an iudicia maiestatis redderentur,

in 15. 49, 6, and with accus.-0f the report
spread in 14. 22, 5: cp. the similar uses
of ‘ differre ' c. 4. 3.

1. Pompeio Macro. On his parentage
and death, see on 6. 18, 4.

iudicia . . . redderentur. This is
not strictly equivalent to ‘ius reddere‘
(⁶ to give sentence,’ e. g. 6. 11, 1 ; 13. 51,
Ι, etc.), but rather to ‘iudices dare‚' i.e.
to receive a ease and assign jurors to try
it: cp. ‘iudicium redditur an reus sit
causa mortis ' Quint. 7. 4, 43.

2. exercendas leges, From this an-
swer to the praetor it is to be gathered
that, besides the numerous trials for
¹ maiestas' held before the senate, which
alone are reported by Tacitus, other per-
sons, apparently of lower rank, must have
been tried under this law before the
courts.

earmina. Some such pasquinades are
quoted by Suetonius (Tib. 59). Pa-
conianus was charged later with a similar
offence (6. 39, 1).

3. discordem eum matre animum:
cp· 3· 64, 1³ 4· 57, 4-

5. modicis equitibus. Those are
meant who had little or no more than
the bare equestrian census, as distinct
from the ‘illustres equites ; ' on whom see
2. 59, 4. Cp. ‘modicos senatores' 11. 7, 7.

6. praetemptata, ‘essayed ; ' a poetical
word, found in prose from Pl. mai.

7. dein repressum sit, etc. It is
possible, with Wasther, to extend ‘Tiberii
arte’ to these words, as denoting‚ not any
special pen’od of repression during his
time (for the reference to 3. 56, 1 is irre-
levant to this law), but his general tend-
ency, during all the years immediately
succeeding this revival of the law, to
moderate the zeal of accusers under it.

Rubrio crimini dabatur violatum

See Introd. viii. p. 122, etc. Or we may,
with Nipperdey, limit ‘Tiberii arte’ to

‘inrepseritss and find the period of repres-
sion in the interval before its revival noted
in 815, A. D. 62 (14. 48, 3). Lipsius under-
stands it of the reaction under Vespasian
and Titus3 but the words of Tacitus seem .
to confine the periods at least within the·
limits of this work. The subsequent out-
burst (‘ postremo arserit ’ etc.) might, no
doubt, equally suit the history of the last
years of Tiberius, or of Nero, or of Domi-
tian.

9. cultores Augusti. Similar titles
are found in inscriptions, e. g. ‘imaginum
domus Aug. cultores’ (Orell. 738); ‘cul-
tores domus divinae et fortunae Aug ’.(1d
1662).T11e‘cu1tus'0f Aug ustugs and
his family m private houses' is gillustrated
hythe description in Ovid (ex P. 4. Q}
¹⁰5‘¹.¹⁰) of a shrine in his own house
with images of Augustus, Augusta, Tibe· ξ
rius, and the two grandsons. The present g

passage shows that such private ‘cultus’
had existed while Augustus was living, in
a form probably analogous to the muni·
cipal worship (see on c. 10, 5): also that
the greater houses (‘ domus’ ) kept up for
it, each for themselves or in combination,
a body or bodies of persons of low rank,
who were constituted, as it were, in ‘col-
legia: i.e. were analogous to the ‘collegia
cultorum ’ of a less private character. On ,
the general subject of this ‘cultus‚’ see
Marquardt, Staatsv. iii. p. 443, etc.

10. habebantur, ‘were kept up cp

‘mos habebatur’(13.16,1),and many
instances, collected 3here by Nipp„ of
more or less kindred uses of this verb· m
Tacitus and Sallust

11. statuam Augusti . . . mancipas-
set. Lipsius quotes the maxim ofjurists
