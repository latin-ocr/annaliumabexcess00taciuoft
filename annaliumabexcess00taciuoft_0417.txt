their nobles were subsequently the first of
‘Gallia comata ’ to become senators of
Rome (11. 25, 1).

Iulius Sacrovir. This name again,
as also that of Iulius Indus (e. 42, 35, sug-
gest a gift of citizenship by Julius or
perhaps Augustus: the cognomen here
may indicate that the first who bore it

*by German settlements. Their chief town
was the ‘Colonia,' or ‘Augusta Treve-
torum’ (H. 4. 62, etc.; Mela 3. 2), now
'Trier or Treves. Their country was chosen
'u the refuge of Agrippina (1. 41, 2), and
they must have been then thought trust-
worthy. Afterwards they are frequently
mentioned in the rebellion of Civilis. By
v ‘the time of Tacitus (G. 28, 4) they counted
i ⁴themselves to be of German origin, which
’ *troald show that they had become much
’ mixed with German blood.

2. bona faeta, i.e. services to Rome:
ep. ‘bona societas ’ (ι. 57, 7).

3. eum id rarum. Citizenship had
certainly been freely bestowed by the dic-
tator Caesar, and after his death lavished
(Cic. Phil. 1. 10, ¹23; 2. 36, 92) or sold
(Id. 5. 4, 11) by Antonius in his name.
Augustus however, according to Sueto-
nius (Aug. 40), ‘ civitatem parcissime
dedit,’ and Tiberius probably followed
his example: but in the time of Clau-
dius, according to Dio (60. 17, 5), citizen-

5. metum ex flagitiis: cp. ‘ex duce

componunt, ‘they agree.’ The use
is like that of συντίθεσθαι in Xen., etc.
Nipp. notes the use of ‘ compositum’ (4.
10, 2; 68, 3, etc.)‚ and ‘composito (or
‘ex composito ’) facere aliquid’ (H. 4.
66, 2). These phrases are frequent in
Sallust and Livy.

meetings specially convened.

relaxation might have been expected.

9. discordare, ‘was mutinous:‘ cp. 1.
