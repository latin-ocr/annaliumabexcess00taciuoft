6 JNTRODUCTJON.

in 1515, these books appear for the first time among the works of
Tacitus ¹. “

There are some discrepancies as to the circumstances of its ac-
quisition, and neither Fulda nor Hersfeld‚ but the monastery of Corvey,
in Westphalia, is mentioned as the place of its discovery ². Ritter
treats it as identical with the MS. shown to have existed in the ninth
century at Fulda‚ but it has been more generally assigned to the tenth,
by some to the eleventh century ³.

The text, at various stages of its derivation, has sometimes suffered
from a misleading half-knowledge, and more seriously, at a later date,
from complete ignorance of Latinity, added to carelessness of eye or
ear, in its copyists, whereby words have been mutilated and wrongly
divided, letters mistaken or transposed, syllables dropped or assimilated
to those next to them, glosses have crept into the text, or ‘lacunae'
have passed unnoticed 4.

These errors had not wholly escaped the old revisers, whose erasures,
linear and interlinear corrections, and dots placed above or below
letters to be expunged, are now carefully noted ⁶.

The MS. has also a considerable number of marginal corrections,
which are cited by some editors as possessing authority, but which
· Ritter considers to be generally no more¹ than the conjectures of
Beroaldus or of later critics.

From the necessary, many editors have been naturally led on to
more questionable, corrections. The tendency to imagine an error
wherever the language is exceptionally harsh or unusual culminates in
the edition of Ritter above mentioned; whose multitudinous excisions,
inserfions, and corrections, have mostly failed to meet vwith general
acceptance, notwithstanding the ingenuity with which he has advocated
them⁶. But on the actual state of the MS. text, his work is still the
best source of information.

In spite of its enors, the first Medicean is generally considered to

from this MS. as from those of other
parts of the author.

¹ Two editions had already appeared
without them; that of Vindelinus de

Spira (Venice, 1470), and that of Fran-
ciscus Puteolanus (Milan, cir. 1476), be-
sides some five reprints of one or other
of these, down to 1512 (Ruperti, Praef.
cxii.).
