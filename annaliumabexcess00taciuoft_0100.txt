82 INTRODUCTION.

nor has he throne or diadem, but the familiar curule chair, the laurel-
wreath and lictors. His household troops keep the old title of ‘ cohors
praetoria.' Nor is Dio right in representing him as ‘legibus solutus ¹ 3'
his special exemption from some laws ² implying that he is bound by all
others. Again, his family have no dignities except by special decree.
Livia, the type in early times of exceptional female privilege, received
tribunitian sanctity‚ and was made ‘ sui iuris ' in her husband's lifetime⁸z
her honours at his death were strictly limited⁴; her deification at the
time of her death refused⁵; her political influence was only personal:
not till after Domitian does ‘Augusta' become a regular title⁶z only
Agrippina seems formally to share the power of husband or son, and to
be in very deed an ‘ empress :’ the association of the sisters of Gaius in
the oath⁷ seems a mere freak of power: sons of the ruling house are
no more than, and are not always, ‘ principes iuventutis ⁸ ⁹ in youth; and
are afterwards enabled only by special decree⁹ to forestall the lawful age for
magistracies: the households of Caesar are at first no greater than those
of other eminent c' zens¹⁰; his secretaries‚ accountants, etc., no higher
than freedmen. s

Nor could the princeps formally name a successor3 much as he could .

do indirectly to guide the choice of one. The person left heir in his will
had a position of vantage by succeeding to the ‘ fiscus‚' in which public
money was mingled with the ‘res privata principis:' yet neither Livia ¹¹
nor Tiberius Gemellus ¹² acquired by heirship any share of empire. An

act of adoption by the princeps is figuratively called by Tacitus ‘ comitia-

imperii ¹⁸ 3' but such adoption was not limited to one ¹⁴, and hardly receives
its [ull significance till the adoption of Trajan. Similarly the title of
‘ princeps iuventutis‚' though sometimes taken to mark out a successor ¹³,
might be shared by more than one ¹⁶, and was usually dropped at man-
hood. Far more influence would be exerted by the association of an in—
tended heir m the‘ proconsulare 1mperiumss or ‘tribunitia potestas,’ or, as
was the case with Tiberius, in both ¹⁷. But this step was rarely taken, and
