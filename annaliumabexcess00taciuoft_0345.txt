insolescerent : cp. c. 75, 3 ; H. 2.
7, 2. The verb is rare, and mostly of late

. use.

2. duodeviginti. This would show
him to have died in 789, A.D. 36. Vel-
leius (2. 129, 4) alludes to him as detained
‘honorate nec secure.’

3. vivendi cupidinem: cp. the sen-
timent in Juv. 8, 84 ; 15, 106; quoted as
part of the Stoic morality.

. 5. Hermundurorum. These are de-
seribed as a friendly and privileged

ople bordering on Rhaetia (G. 41, 1),

tween the Marcomani and Chatti (Id.
42, 13 Ann. 13. 57, 1). They must
therefore have inhabited Northem Ba-
ntia: and Tacitus (G. 1.1.) must have
been in error in placing them at the
sources of the Elbe. Their position is
different at various times.

Vibilio. He was still their leader
thirty-two years later (12. 29, 2), unless
Ruperti is right in thinking that the word
may be a general name, ‘ WeibeL' =
'dum’ The abl. ,is instrumental, corres-
ponding to ⁸ opibus’ (cp. Introd. v. ς 27).

rorum Iulium, Frejus. This, like
Ravenna, was a naval station (4. 5, 1).

6. barbari . . . comitati, the ‘ clientela: ’
cp. 1. 57, 4, etc. The preoeution here
taken shows their numbers.

8. Earum et cusum. The first of
these, separating the Suebi from the

Daci (Pl. N. H. 4. 12, 25, 81), is the
March or Morava, joining the Danube at
Pressburg; the latter probably is the
VVaag, whose junction with the Danube
is at Komom; though some have identi-
fied it with the Gran and other rivers:
see Orelli.

Vannio, also mentioned in 12. 29, 1.

9. gentis. This kind of genit. is used
with similar brachylogy to that observed
in the genit. of quality (Introd. v. § 34).
Nipp. compares ‘Piraeum Atticae orae’
(5. 10, 4); ‘Albigaunum . . . Liguriae’
(H. 2. 15, 4); ‘fines Vocontiorum ulte-
rioris provinciae ' (Caes. B. G. 1. 10, 5).

Quadorum. This powersul people ad-
joined the Marcomani (G. 42, 1), inhabit-
ing the present Moravia and part of
Hungary3 and were formidable enemies
'm the time of Marcus Aurelius.

10. regem Artaxian: cp. c. 56, 3, and
note ou c. 62, 1.

11. ovantes. The ovation, like the full
triumph (c'p. c. 41, 2), was at that time
reserved to the imperial family. As the
general celebrating it then rode on horse-
back instead of, as formerly, marching
on foot, it is distinguished by Dio as the
triumph ἐπὶ κέλητος (54. 33, 5, etc.).

12. Martis Ultoris This temple, in
the centre of the Forum of Augustus,
was built by him to commemorate his
vengeance on his father's murderers, and
appropriated as the place where insignia
of victories, etc„ should be deposited.

Some remains of it still exist. The arch .

of Drusus on the Appian way is com-
memorative of the elder Drusus (Suet.
