to the frontier of Italy (Vell. 2. 110, 4),
and is identified with Ober-Laybach in
Car-uiola. It is described below as of the
size and character of a municipal town
(cp. ‘in modum municipii exstructus locus ’
H. 1. 67, 4; Id. 4. 22, 1), but its im-

* portance was probably diminished by the
subsequemt foundation of a colony near it
at Ergmna (Iaybach) ι see Pl. N. H. 3.
2 ‚ 2 , 1 .

41. ob 4izinera. The employment of
detachments (⁸ vexilla ') of the legions in
mad-making is attested by numerous in-
fftliss'ffii’ede'ff} ffifflffil’sssfftxa‘ff
P· 450)-

5. praefectum casu-orum. These
officers are frequently mentioned from
the time of Augustus, and seem usually
to have been promoted from the rank of
centurion (cp. 13. 9, 3, with 39. 2), as a
reward of long service (Veget. 2, 10).

v Even in a camp containing several
legions, one praefect only is usually found
(e.g. c. 23, 43 32, 6); though Velleius
(2. 119, 4) mentions two with the army
of Varus. His connection with the
legions is thus accidenta1‚ and he has not
the oeoognised power of a commanding
οῷοετ (see c. 38, 2); but from the in-
sntution of Domitian, by which each
legion has always a separate camp

. (Suet. Dom. 7), the ‘ praefectus castrorum

“ ’ ’ acquires in time the title of

‚aa

⁸ praefectus legionis,' and ultimately takes
the place of the ‘legatus legionis! See
Marquardt‚ Staatsv. ii. p. 444.

6. vehiculo. From a comparison of
¹ corpori derepta ’ (13. 57, 7), this would
appear to be a dative. Otherwise the
verb more often takes an ablative. Both
constructions are poetical.

ιο. vetus operis, This emendation of
Lipsius for the MS. ‘intus' is generally
adopted; such a genitive with ‘vetus'
being in accordance with the usage os
Tacitus (as in 6. 12, 2; 44, 1, etc.), and
suited to ⁶ quia toleraverat.’ 'the alterna-
tive emendation ‘intentus’ has in its
favour the fact of similar accidental
omissions of a syllable in the MS. (as
‘reditus' for ‘rediturus' 2. 63, 5); and
though no genitive with this word is
found, such a construction would be
analogous to ‘ferox scelerum’(4. 12, 3),
or other genitives of relation.

13. carcere. Such a place of custody
formed part of all ‘castra stativa: ’ cp.
‘militari custodia ' 3. 22, 55 ‘longo
castrorum in carcere mansit ' Juv. 6, 560.

14. etiam tum. This period is dis-
tinguished from the complete break—down
of discipline described in c. 23.

16. centuriam . . . euius manipularis
erat, ‘the century in whose ranks he
served! ‘Manipularis ’ is related no less
to ‘centuria’ than to ‘manipulus,' being
merely a term for the rank and file os a
