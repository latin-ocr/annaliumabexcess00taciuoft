42 INTR ODUCTION.

  
 

ademptae virilitatis 6. 31, 3. Such brachylogy is also found in Caesar
and Livy. Dr. ξ 72.

35. Such genitives as morum 1. 80, 2 ; flagitii 3. 20, 2 ; sui muneris ,
15. 52, 4 (Nipp. on 3. 20); also concise uses of the gen. of sort, as
Vannius gentis Quadorum 2. 63, 7 (where see Nipp.); may be taken as ,
qualitative, or may be referred to the class noted in § 32.

36. The elliptical genitive of the gerundis an idiom apparently
without real parallel in any other author. The only instances are in the i
later books of the Annals: nec grave . . . retinendi 13. 26, 43 penitus in- ³²
fixum erat . . . vitandi 15. 5, 3 ; maneat. . . potentiam . . . ostentandi 15. 21,3. l
The gerund qualifies the substantiva] notion of a burden (implied in l
‘ grave ³) or a custom (implied in ‘ fixum’ or ‘maneat'). Dr. ξ 204, Kennedy
185. 3

37. 'I'he gerundivo genitive (see the corresponding dat. § 22 b) is j
used more frequently by Tacitus than by any other writer, and, in its
most remarkable forms, is especially characteristic of the Annals (Wolfflin,
Phil. 25. 1 13). The usages may be thus classified :—

(a) In its simplest J‘brm, it is part qs an ordinary definz'ng genitive .· the
expressions ‘ oratores pacis ' and ‘ oratores pacis petendae ’ being equiva-
lent (see Roby‚ Pref. lxvii).

(b) T he gerundive becomes a more essential part of the expression, and,
with the noun, has the force os a genitive of quality: as bellum abo-

lendae infamiae 1. 3, 6 ; pecunia omittendae delationis 6. 3ο, 1. Cp. 3.
27, 1, etc.

(c) The expression above might be used predz'catively with ‘esse'
expressed (Liv.) or implied (Sall. Jug. 88, 4), or with ‘videri,' as quae
conciliandae misericordiae videbantur 11. 3, 1.

(d) The genitive qualz’fies the whole sentence (Roby 1288), as Aegyptum
proficiscitur cognoscendae antiquitatis 2. 59, 1. Cp. 3. 9, 2 ; 41, 43 13.
11, 2, etc. This usage, though found in Terence, Sallust, and Velleius, is
distinctly Tacitean by reason of its comparative rarity both before and
after him. It may be best taken as a Graecism, like τὸ ληστικὸν καθήρει,
τοῦ τὰς προσόδους μᾶλλοιὲ ἰέναι αὐτῷ (Thuc. 1. 4). Wblfflin would supply
the idea of a substantive, as ‘proficiscitur, quod (sc. proficisci) cogno-
scendae antiquitatis erat.' Nipp. (on 2. 59) gives, from Em. Hoffmann,
a sornewhat different classification of these usages. The gerundial gen.
is rarely thus used, as in 3. 27, 2.
