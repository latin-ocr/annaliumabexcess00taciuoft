40. Eo in metu arguere Germanicum omnes, quod non ad
superiorem exercitum pergeret, ubi obsequia et contra rebellis
auxilium: satis superque missione et pecunia et mollibus con-

sultis peccatum.

cunctatus-aspemantem uxorem, cum se divo Augusto ortam
neque degenerem ad pericula testaretur, postremo uterum eius
et communem filium multo cum fletu complexus, ut abiret

uxor, parvulum sinu filium gerens, lamentantes circum amicorum
coniuges, quae simul trahebantur, nec minus tristes qui mane-

bant.

41. Non florentis Caesaris neque suis in castris, set velut in
urbe victa facies; gemitusque ac planctus etiarn militurn aures
Β oraque advertere: prog'rediuntur contuberniis. quis ille flebilis

So ‘defendere’ ‘to plead in excuse,' 13.

- 43, 4, etc.

ι. Eo in metu3 'Jnetus ' seems to be
used of circumstances causing sear, rather
than sear itself: .cp. ‘ ostendere metum ex
Tiberio' (2. γι, 2); ‘nihil metus’ (=‘ni·
hil metuendum ¹) ‘in vultu’ Agr. 44, 2.
A similar use of ‘terror’ (11. 19, 1, etc.)

- is classidal, and ‘formido’ (Agr. 22, 1)

⁷ words is studied for effect.

is so used by Sall.

’ 6. avo. On the use of terms of adop-
tive relationship, see on c. 33. 3. That
of the boy alone is mentioned, as he, in
virtue os this adoptive relationship, stood
nearer than Agrippina to Tiberius. Nipp.
. diu cunctatus aspernantem . . .

-. perpulit. Two distinct causes are as-

zigned for the delay; his own hesitation.
and the pride of his wife3 which latter is

’ explained by ⁸ cum se . . . testaretur!

8. damnarem. This tical word

² had been introduced into prose by Liv.

and P1.mai. The construction with ‘ad’
(which would be in full ‘ ad pericula sub-
eunda'), not found elsewhere, is analo-
gous to that of ‘praecipuos ad scelera‚’
‘ad pericula’ (6. 7, 3; 14. 58. 1).

10. incedebat. This implies the ab·
senne of such vehicla as would usually
be provided. ‘Muliebre’ and ‘ misera-
bile tre also emphatic, and the order of
⁴ They were

z §ttrfing on soot, a train of women, and
χ . ιιι pitiable plight?

12. qui manebant, i.e. the husbands
and friends parting from them.

14. florentis, ‘ in prosperity: ' cp. c. 53,
2; 16. 33, ι, etc.

15. facies. Gronov. has rightly ex-
plained this, as not · facies Caesaris? but
¹ facies remm' (cp. c. 49, 1) ‘non florenti
Caesari, sed urbi captae conveniens.' It
seems better, with Nipp., to place a semi-
colon at ‘sacies,’ and to take the sentence
in apposition with the last of the preced-
ing chapter, than, with Halm, to join it
with ⁸ gemitusque,' etc„ as subject of
‘ advertere’ '

16. advertere, ‘ attracted‚’ as 2. 17, 2:
4. 21, 5; 6. 44. 1, etc. For other uses
os the word. see 3. 52, 2 ; 4. 54, 2, etc.

progrediuntur contuberniis. Ta-
citus appears to follow the ‘progredior
portu’ of Verg. Aen. 3. 300. On other
such abladves, see Introd. 5. ξ ²4·

quis ille, etc. The construction is
here to be taken as designedly broken
and exclamatory, to express the agitation
of the speakers. ‘What is this sound of
mourning ἰ’ What this sight so sad? Here
are women of rank—not a centurion—not
a soldier as escort—not a mark of the
general's wife or of her usual retinue—set-
ting out sor the Treviri’ 2 etc. Such ex-
clamatory sentences are given in 14. 8, 4,
and, according to some, in c. 3 5, 2 (‘ neu
mortem,' etc.). With ‘ quod‚' we should
expect a substantive (cp. ¹ quod nomen,'
