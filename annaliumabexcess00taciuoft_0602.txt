Syria had been vacated in 786, A.D. 33

(c. 27, 3), it is probable that Vitellius
may have been sent out earlier as legate
of that province, and may now have re-
ceived some extension of power similar
to that of Germanicus (2. 43, 2). A fuller
account of his actions in Syria and Pales-
tine, including his recall of Pilate just
before the death of Tiberius, is given in
Joseph. Ant. 183 c. 4, 5. See also Prof.
Rawlinson, p. 228, sqq.

6. in regendis, ‘in’ is inserted by
Halm and Orelli, after Otto: see on 3.

here defends the MS. text by many in-
stanees from Tacitus and other authors,
which seem hardly parallel, as the im-
mediate proximity here of another abl.
makes it the less probable that this one
stood without a preposition.

7. regressus, etc. He was recalled by
Gaius in 793, A. D. 40, to answer a charge,
and escaped by abject servility (Dio, 59.
27, 4). On his conduct towards Claudius,
Messalina, and Agrippina, see 11. 2, 4;

14. Artaxata: see 2. 56, 3.

15. Parthorum. The MS. has ‘partho-
rumque,’ whence it has been thought that
a word has dropped out, such as ‘Ario—
rum ’ (cp. 11. 10, 3), conjectured by
Bezzenb, or ‘ Medorum ⁷ (c. 34, 6, where,
however, it seems to be another name
for the Parthians), by Heraus. Beroald.

‘stipendia facere,’ but as equivalent to
