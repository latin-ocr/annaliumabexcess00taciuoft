ow ing to the bend which it makes between
Minden and Rinteln‚ would be also in the
rear of the fugitives (c. 17, 8). The main
body would extend from west to east,
partly on the plain, partly within the out-
skirts of the wood immediately behind
them (see above). The heights occupied
by the Cheruscans appear to have been
on the right wing‚ and to have formed
the key of the whole position, enabling
them to fall on the flank of the Romans
as they advanced.

2. proeliantibus. Nipp. takes this to
be abl. abs„ asTacitus usually has the
accus. with ‘ incurrere' (e. g. c. 17, 1 ; 1.
51, 6, ete.).

3. sie incessit: compare the march-
ing order in 1. 51, 5, and note there. ,

5. praetoriis cohortibus: these ⁴are
mentioned again c. 20, 6. Ritter thinks
that the personal guards, belonging to the
two legati. Silius and Caecina, are in-
tended; and compares Cic. Ep. ad Fam.
10. 30, 1 ‘ Antonius . . eduxit . . cohortes
praetorias duas, unam suam, alteram
Silani! But Nipp. appears rightly to
argue that the term must at this time
naturally refer to the force so' well known
under the name; and that, as two such
cohorts were sent with Drusus to Illyri-
eum (1. 24, ἢ, two others may have been
sent out to Germanicus. 1-t is also pos-
sible, that, in recognition of his rank, two
such may have originally accompanied
him to Germany.

7. ceteraeque. Ritt. appears rightly
to take these to be troops specially en-
rolled for this expediti0n; the auxiliaries
regularly belonging to the legions having

been already mentioned, as ‘levis arma-
tura‚'etc.

intentus paratusque. Em. points
out that this is a kind os formula, and
is used in Sall. Cat. 27, 2 ς Jug. 49, 33
and often in Livy.

8. adsisteret. Tacitus has often this
word in a military sense, usually meaning
to take up a position, as e. 17, 4; 19· 4;
12. 5⁶3 «⁹3³ 14. 34, 3; H. 3. 63, ¹3 82, 3.
Here 1t ls taken with brachylogy. as equi-
valent to ‘ consisteret et se explicaret;’
‘that the order of march might deploy
into line of battle ; ' i. e. that each should
stand next in line to those to whom they
had been next in column. The army
would appear to have deployed to the
left. as those who had marched first were
saeing the Cherusci (c. 17, 6).

cover ; and that they were to have been
coneealed till the moment of attack (c.
16, 4); but their impetuosity betrayed
their position. The attack in flank

12. augurium, used, like ‘auspiciis'
(c. 14, 2), of the omen. So in Liv. etc.
The verb is adapted to the noun in apposi-
tion, asin 3. 21, 2 ; 13. 37, 4 (where see
Nipp.); 14. 27, 2, etc.

octo aquilae. Crities have super-
fluously noted, that eagles are now rarely
if ever seen in those parts, and that their
nearest representative, the ‘vultur albu-
ciuus‚’ is not gregarious. The number,
