{is' appi-sar to originate with Sen. and
ιε.

1. Illyricum. This must here be
taken to include the frontier province os
Pannonia (c 1.16,1·„46 1, etc.,) prob·
ably also R aetia and Noricum (c. 63,
1). Drusus would appear to have been
sent with‘ imperium maius? and there
fore, like Germanicus, to have had‘ im-
perium proconsulare: ’ see note on 3.19,
4. Moesia may also have been within
the terms, but must have been outside the
practical scope os his commission.

suesceret, with dat. as 1. 31, 4, ete.

3. luxu. This trait in him is noted in
3 ἓὲᾳιιθ tutiorem rebatur. This
thought would qualify, without wholly
ιιεειιιιίνίιις(1 his suspicions of Germanicus.

ee ntio viii. 120.

4. S6uebi. Oii this people, see note on
1· 44, ·

6. ao vacui. The conj. might be
taken, with Walther. as explanatory, or,
with Nipp.‚ as implying that not only
were the Romans gone, but that the
Germans were free from all sear of any
foreigner ; and ‘discessu' might be, like
‘ visu‘ (3. 14, 3), an abl. of circumstance,
closely akin to an abl. absol. But there
is much ground sor treating ‘ac,’ with
Orelli, as an error arising from the first
syllable of ‘ vacui?

gentis adsuetudine: see note on
c. 26, . ·

8. lfaroboduum. Thepositiompower,
and character of this prince are noticed
below (c. 63), and more sully described in
Vell. 2. 108, 1093 where he is shown to
have consolidated under a royal title (cp.

q
l

'regis nomen’ here) ' Bohemia, the,
most powerful combination that had yet
been seen among the Germans, with a
standing force of 70, 000 soot and 4000
horse, in alarming proximity to the Ro·-
man frontier. .;

9. habebat. Drager appears rightly ⁴
to explain this harsh zeugma by resolving ·
the verb m the first clause, into‘ reddebat,’ « “
and 1n the last, into ‘.sequebatur' Nipp. .
takes it, in the second clause, to mean -’

‘held him to be a champion of freedom,'· ’”
supposing the historian to imply (see c.
88, 3) that he was not really so. But 5
this explanation seems to make the zeug- ,
ma still harsher, and the word wholly
ambiguous, =

11. sumpsere bellum. This expres· ,
sion, frequent in Sall. and Liv., a pears ¹
to be taken from Greek: cp. π λεμον
ἤραντο Thuc. 3. 39, 3.

12. Semnonen. These lived beyond ,ι
the Elbe (Vell. 2. 106, 2), between that ,
river and the Oder; and were reached by ' ’
Tiberius in 758, Α. D. 5, and made terms
with Rome (Μοιι. Anc. v. 17; Vell. 1. 1.). ’
Strabo (7. 1, 3, 290) notes them as a ‘
Suebic race and subject.to Maroboduus. ‘j
In G. 39, 4, they are stated to be nume- ’
rically the most important subdivision of
that race. .

Langobardi. This famous people, J j

‘gens etiam Germana feritate ferocior’ ” ¹
(Vell. 1.1.), are first heard of on the south -’ ’
side of the Lower Elbe, next to thes ,
Chauei; and are thought to have beenj ἵ
among those driven across that river, prob·' ,
ably by Tiberius (Suet. Aug. τι). Stra· v? ἒ
(1.1.) calls them Λαγκόβαρδοι, and place
them beyond the Elbe.1n the time 0 ,⁷
Tacitus they were distinguished, ι’]ιοιιςι. 4
