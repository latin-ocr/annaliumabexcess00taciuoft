CORNELII TACITI ANNALJUM [A. U. C. 769.

moto eius vultu excipitur. mox libellos et auctores recitat Caesar
ita moderans, ne lenire n-eye asperare crimina videretur.

30. Accesserant praeter Trionem et Catum accusatores ‚Fon-1
teius Agrippa et C. Vibius, certabantque cui ius perorandijn
5 reum daretur, donec Vibius, quia nec‘ ipsi inter se concederent et
Libo sine patrono introisset, singillatim· se crimina obiecturum ’
professus, protulit hbe *los vaecordes adeo, ut consultaverit‘Libo,
an habiturus foret opes quis viam Appiam Brundisium usque

pecunia operiret.

10 mollius acciperes, miseranda.

inerant et alia huiusce modi stolida vana, si-
uni tamen libello manu Libonis

nominibus Caesarum aut senatorum additas atroces vel occultas

notas accusator arguebat.
tormenta interrogari placuit.

quaestio in caput domini prohibebatur, callidus et novi iuris

1. libellos et auctores, ‘the informa-
tions and names of the informers.’

2. moderans, ‘restraining himself ;'
so ‘ moderante ‘ 1. 15. 2 : usually a dative
is expressed‚ as c. 70, 43 6. 2, 6, etc.

3. Fonteius Agrippa; mentioned
again c. 86, 1. Another, probably his
son, is mentioned H. 3. 46, 5.

4. C. Vibius; the elder Serenus: see
4. 13, 23 28, 1, etc.

perorandi, ‘making the formal ora-
tion! The word often means no more
than this (cp. 3. 17, 7 and‘ perorare eau-
sam’ in Cic„ etc..) Nipp. notes that the
proper place of such oration was at the
close of the evidence.

6. singillatim, ‘one by one3’ so that
they might be argued separately without
a continuous oration on either side.
Cicero adopted a somewhat similar
course, to expedite the trial of Verres:
Nero enforced this practice generally in
trials before himself ε ‘cognoscendi mo-
rem eum tenuit, ut continuis actionibus
omissis, singillatim quaeque per vices
ageret’ (Suet. Ner. 15).

7.libe1108‚papers belonging to Libo.
consultaverit == ‘consultavisse mon-
straretur!

10. uni . . . libello. ‘Nominibus’
must be taken as a dative depending on
‘additas, · ’ and it is not more difficult to
extend the same construction, than to
supply any other (such as ‘inesse 'from

‘inerant ) sor‘ libello! Also the correc-
tion‘ uno ’(Kritz and Nipp. ) still leaves
an awkwardness in the juxtaposition of
two different ablatives, ‘libello’ and

‘.’manu It seems therefore necessary to
suppose some negligenee in the original
composition.

11. Caesarumautsenatorum‚ i..e some
to the one set of names, others to the
Iother: see on 1. 55, 2, and Nipp.'s note

ere.

atroces vel occultas notas, ‘dead-
ly, or at least mysterious symbols? 1t is
meant that, if no meaning could be made
out of them, the mystery was itself sus-
picious. We are to suppose that oeba·
listic characters were attached to the
names, and that it was suggested that
these might be a magical⁸ devotio’ (see
on c. 69, 5). It is implied by ‘'tamen
that this document was the onlyy relevant
evidence; so that the whole charge ap-
pears to have tumed ou these unintelli-
gible marks.

ι2 adgnoscentes: cp. ‘noscerent’ c.
28,1. Nipp. calls attention to this illus-

„tm

negante reo adgnoscentes seruos per}
et quia vetere senatus consulto

tration of the rule by which slaves were 3
forced to confirm, under torture, even ι
what they were willing to state without
it; their evidence being not otherwise ξ

legal.

13. vetere senatus consulto. This 3·

mle, called‘ mos maio’rum yCicero
(pro Deiot.1‚ 3), had even in bhis time
exceptions in cases of incest and conspi-
racy (Mil 22, 595 Partt.Oratt.34,118).
Lips. states that the later jurists also
make exception in charges of‘ maiestas'
(without the fiction here introduced).
adultery, and‘ fraudatio census!

14. novi iuris. Dio (55. 5. 4), repre·

sents this as a contrivance of

Augustus
