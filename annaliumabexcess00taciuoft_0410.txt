and may have meant to glance at her
conduct (1. 69, 2). On the dative ‘de-
cursu,’ cp. c. 30, 4.

2. plura uxoribus obiectari. Prior
to this date, no other instance but that of

Plancina seems to be known to us. After· .

wards the case of Sosia (4. 4) may be
cited, also those of Paxaea (169 29 .;1 Dio,
58 24, 3), of Cornelia, wife of 9Calvisius
Sabinus (Dio, 59. 18, 4), and of the wife
of Classicus (Pl. Epp. 3. 9, 19). Juvenal
also (8‚128) pictures the governor' s wife
hovering as a harpy over provincial towns.
4. negotia, especially (as Nipp. notes)
such transactions as the prosecutor on a
charge of ‘ repetundae ¹ would cite.
duorum egressus, etc„ ‘there were
two to be escorted to public places, two
centres of government.⁸ ‘Praetorium’ is
the regular term sor the governor's resi-
dence (as inN. T. etc.) and hence used
of other mansions: see Prof. Mayor on
Juv 1, 75. Here it is explained by the
‘mulierum iussa) more persistent and
imperious than those of their husbands.
6. Oppiis, the plural, here and in c. 34,
6 is probably to be taken as rhetorical
(cp. 1. 10, 3). The‘ lex Oppia,’ restrain-
ing the ornaments, dress, and vehicles of

in spite of the vehement protest of Cato,
represented in a speech by Livy (34.1—8):

aliis; as for instance the ‘lex Vo-
conia,’'1imiting the right of women to
inherit, a law which though unrepealed
appears to have been very inoperative:

8. obturbabant, ‘were interrupting'
(cp. 6. 24, 4), with such remarks as follow.

neque relatum: see c. 33, 1.

10. censorem, used invidiously3 the
only censorial sunctions being now vested
in Caesar. Tiberius himself says (2. 33,
6) ‘non id tempus censurae.’

Valerius Messalinus: see on 1. 8, 5.

Messalla. M. Valerius M. f. M. n. Mes-·
salla Corvinus, the celebrated orator and
friend of Horace, Ovid, and Tibullus,
was born ln 695, Β. c. 59, was consul with
Caesar in the year of Actium, and died
about 764, A. 1)y 11. On his‘ praefectura

1. 47, 3, considers that the MS. readings ¹*
