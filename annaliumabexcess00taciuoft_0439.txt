well known as another name of Delos

13.9post interfectos cyclopas. For
the general form of this legend, see Eur.
Alc. 3-8, etc.

14. Liberum patrem, etc. Dionysus,
according to one legend (Plut. Quaest.
Gr. 56). pursued the Amazons from Ephe-
sus to Samos and there slew them; ac-
cording to another (Diod. 3. 71, etc.),
united with them against the Titans. The
legend of Amazons in Western Asia is
found in Homer (11. 3, 1893 6, 186).
Pindar, according to Pausanias (7. 2, 7),
ascribed to them the foundation of the
Ephesian temple ; another legend (see 4.
56, 1) makes an Amazon foundress of
Smyrna. The Attic legend respecting
them (Hdt. 9. 27, 5, etc.) is famous from
its representations in art.

15. aram insiderant. Here equivalent
to the Greek καθίζεσθαι ἐπὶ τοὺς βωμούς
Thuc. 3. 28, 2, etc. This form of the
perfect may probably have been preferred
by Tacitus as the less usual: cp. 1. 3ο, 5,
and, on the indic, Introd. v. ξ 49.

cum Lydia poteretur. Most le-
gends represent Heracles in Lydia as the
slave of Omphale: cp. Soph. Trach. 248,
etc.
