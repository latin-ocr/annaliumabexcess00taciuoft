1. conpressam=‘violatam.' Sueto-
nius (Tib. 61). as in other cases, exagge-
rates this single instance into a general
practice. Dio (47. 6, 6) gives an instance
in which a youth was made to assume the
toga virilis before being executed.

oblisis: so ‘obliso gutture’ App. M.
4. 12, 263. Cicero has ‘collum digi-
tulis oblideret' (p. Scaur. 6, 10).

2. in Gemonias: cp. 3. 14, 6, etc. Ac-
cording to the order of events followed
by Dio (58. 11, 6), this execution is made
to precede the revelation made by Api-
cata respecting the murder of Drusus and
guilt of Livia.

4. acri, ‘active:' so used of ‘causae’
(1. 33, 3), ‘initia ⁹ (6. 17, 5, etc), ‘gloria ‘
and ‘ paenitentia ’ (H. 3. 51, 4), ete.

Drusum. The true Drusus was a
prisoner in the Palatium: see 6. 23, 5.

6. velut adgnitus, etc. The text here
follows that of the MS„ only adopting
the interlineation (‘que’) instead of the
reading of the first hand (¹qui'). Haase
reads ‘velut adgnitus per dolum; quis comi-
tantibus,' etc.; but ‘per dolum’ would
thus be surplusage, as ‘velut’ of itself
implies that the recognition was only
pretended. For the position of ‘que '
Nipp. compares ‘ab oratoribusque’ (16.
2, 3), and cites also many instances in
which, as here, a ‘pronominal ablative is
supplied, from a foregoing noun, with the
abl. abs. following (see Introd. v. ξ 31 c,
and note on c. 47, 4). The freedmen
pretended to recognise him, and as they
dishonestly followed him those who knew.
nothing were attracted. ,

8. promptis . . . animis, another abl.
abs„ assigning a ground for their readi-

ness to receive him. This characteristic ’
of the Greek mind is noted in the Athe-
nians of that time (Acts 17, 21). On the ”
estimate generally formed of Greeks by ’
Romans, see Friedl. i. p. 74: cp. 2. 53, ε
4;55‚1;6.18,5. ,ἱ
elapsum custodiae. The MS. ‘lap- s.
sum’ is thus corrected by all editors. ξ
Elsewhere, Tacitus has the accus. with A]
‘elabi' (as 1. 61, 6, etc.); but in some ,ἦ
instances from other authors the cases ’κ’
generally taken as simple ablatives might ’ ³4
be datives, as ‘telis ’ (Verg. Aen. 2, 318), Ξ
etc. ‘Custodia' is read by some, aster :53
Lips., ‘custodias ’ might be suggested by ³ -
the example of H. 3. 59, 4. s.
9. paternos, the armies of the East. y j
commanded by Germanicus i1r his last , ’
years.
10. fingebant . . . credebantque. This, ‘¹
as well as other expressions here, appear '3
to be repeated from the similar account ·
of the false Nero (H. 2. 8, 1).
11. publicis, i. e. of provincial com· 2²·
munities: cp. the use os‘ publice ' (4. 36, ’ ⁵
2), etc. ’ ’
frequentabatur, ‘ was thronged:’ so 33⁴»

‘ celebrabant,' in
Agrippa (2. 40, 1). ,Α
12. inanium spe. Nipp. thinks the *f
correction ‘inani ' necessary, as it was his?
hope, not its objects, that was visionary3 ’,ι-ς ³
but ‘inania ' appears to be here naturally ⁴2 A ,
contrasted with ‘praesentia : ' ep. ’ἰηαηίαΞ-,Ῑ
famae' (2. 76, 2). Joh. Miiller (Beitn' ’ ’
sect. 3. p. 54) would prefer ‘inani in spe,’⁷ ,
noting the frequent use of ‘in spe esse 15]st
in Cic. and Liv. ᾗ-,γ ⁹
Poppaeo Sabino: see on 1. 80, Ιῑ, ;
4. 46, 1. “’
