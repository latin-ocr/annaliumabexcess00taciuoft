6. 44, 3, etc. The metaphor in ‘differre
aliquem rumoribus’ (1. 4, 3) appears to
be similar (see note there).

1. paucis familiarium adhibitis. On
the informal, and subsequent formal ern-
ployment of assessors, see Introd. vi. p.
74²· hino, ‘from the other side:’ cp.
‘illic’ 1. 70, 6, etc.

ad senatum remittit. This becomes
a technical expression (see Introd. l. l.;
Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p. 863). If the
princeps did not himself take up the case
or ⁶ remit ’ it, it seems that it would na-
turally fall through: cp. ‘relationem de
eo Caesar ad senatum non remisit’ Pl.
Epp. 9. 13, 22.

4. Illyrico. On the abl. cp. 2, 69,
etc.; Introd. v. ξ 24; 011 the departure
of Drusus, cp. c. 7, 1. -

5. censuissent: cp. 2. 64, 1. If the
view given on 2. 62, 1 of the chronology
of these events is correct, ‘ priore aestate '
must either be an interpolation (see note
on c. 20, 1), or must be referred to the
summer preceding the decree itself.

7. P. Vinicium. The MS. has ‘ful-
nicium.¹ It appears plain that the latter
part is a corruption of ‘Vinicium,’ but
there has been much question as to the
proper praenomen. See Baiter, in Orelli
not. crit. The above is adopted by Halm
and N ipp. from Borghesi, as on the whole
nearest to the MS„ and as the name os the
consul of 755, A.D. 2, who is mentioned
by M. Seneca (Contr. vii. 11, and other
places) and L. Seneca (Ep. 40, 9), as an
orator. He was father of the consul of
783, A.D. 30 (Vell. 2. 103, 1). For fur-
ther particulars respecting the family, see
Nipp.’s note.

Aeserninum Marcellum, son of the
consul of 732, B.c. 22, and, through his
mother Asinia, a grandson of Pollio;
who is said to have regarded him, even

in his boyhood, as the chief heir of his
own eloquence <M.Sen.Cont1. 4. praef.
3). He was curator riparum' et alvei
Tiben's, praetor peregrinus (probably in ’ἵ
772, A.D. 19), and cos. suff. in some un· ξ
known year (see Nipp.). In 11. 6, 4, his ξ
name as an orator is coupled with that of ,ξ
Arruntius, and compared with those of ..j
Pollio and Messala. ᾖ
8. Sex. Pompeium: see on 1. 7, 3,
and below, c. 32, 2, and note on c. 72, 4.
On his proconsulate of Asia, see Introd.
vii. p. 96. His ‘facundissimus sermo’ is ..¹
mentioned by Val. Max. (2. 6, 8). ξ
iisque. Nipp. notes that such an infor· ἓ
mality of construction as is here caused by
the interposition of this abl. abS„ bring· '
ing in another circumstance, has its pa- ζ
rallels in earlier Latinity, as in Sallust, {³
‘ dispersos . . . neque minus hostibus con· ἓν
turbatis . . . contrahit' (Jug. 98, 4), and ·
Livy, ‘honorem huic petenti, meisque . . .
adiectis precibus, mandetis' (5. 18, 5);
‘inter exercitus . . . imperatore tanto . . .
deleto, et . . . exspectantes ¹ (²5· 35, 2); ἑ
and is a frequent usage in Greek, as in}
Thuc. 4. 29, 1 ; 8. 106, 5. ᾗ
excusantibus, ‘pleading in excuse :¹ ⁴=
cp. 5. 2, 1; 15. 61, 1; also in Cic. etc. .’
9. Μ’. Lepidus: see on c. 32, 2; 1, j·-
13. 2, etc. > Α
ἰὶι. Piso: see on 2. 32, 43 34, 1. From 'i
his being called Γναίου υἱός by Dio (Arga ’ἕ
Β. 55), Nipp. infers him to have been a j·
brother of the accused : cp. c. 12, 9. 'l
Livineius Regulus, also a consular ¹,
probably father of the one alluded to ” ‘⁷
14. 17, 1. One of the name is mention ¹

 

  
     
     
 
  

expressing expectation or wonder. ‘
rigo ' is found here alone in Tacitu ⁴,
also in poets, Sall. and Liv. Ξ.
