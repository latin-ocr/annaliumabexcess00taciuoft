Muretus for the MS. ‘tergi-1! The objec-
tion of Walther, that an advancing army
could not be said ‘ terga obicere: need
not be pressed. The point is that as
they had fled before they might be ex·
pected to fly again: ⁸ some meet the
enemy again with wounds on their backs,
some with limbs maimed by wave and
storm3’ alluding to those who had re-
treated with Caecina (1, 63-68), or with
Vitellius (id. 70). The thought is here
repeated from H. 5. 16, 3 ‘ superesse, qui
fugam animis, qui vulnera tergo ferant?

oete ictus’ (Agr. 36, 2); ‘praelia,’ ‘vul-
nera’ (Verg.); ‘ arma’ (Lucam).

5. meminissent: cp. ‘meminissent
. . . praeliorum' c. 45, 5. The tense is
equivalent to an imperf„ as ‘memini’ to
a present.

sion of an interrogative particle, though
not unusual with Tacitus in energetie

poteram’ 13. 21, 8, and in other authors
(cp. Madvig, 5 450), is most unusual in
oratio obliqua. No other instance ap-
pears to be given but 14. 61, 5 ‘malle

7. Idimviso. Halm and Nipp. adopt
this correction of the MS. ‘Idista viso'
from J.-Grimm‚ who explains it to mean
‘Nympharum pratum’ (‘Elfenwiese’)‚
the first part being the plural of the old
German ‘ldis‘ (‘nympha’); such nymphs
being represented in an old poem as con-
tmllmg destiny like the Valkyries (see
the quotation in Orelli's note). Nipp.

takes the case here as nom. according to
the general usage of Tacitus in respect of
substantives: e. g. 1. 45, 1 3 c. 4, 33 80,
1; 3. 21, ²3 42, 2; etc. For other in-
stances, see his note; for exceptions‚ and
for the usage with adjectives, see note on
4. 59, 2; Introd. v. ξ 16.

8. is medius, etc. The obscurity of
the whole geography of this campaign
(see c. 9, 1) must affect all attempts to
fix this locality, supposed to lie between

nentia montium,’ also between ‘cedunt'
and ‘resistunt.’ This would be best ex-
plained by supposing (with Ernesti and
Orelli) that the plain is broad where the
river bank recedes from the mountains
(i. e. bends westward)‚ and narrow where
the mountain spurs resist it (i. e. where it
would take a tum to the east and is
stopped by them). Nipp. takes ‘ripae
fluminis‚’ in a somewhat forced sense,
of the whole river-valley, and explains
‘ cedunt' of the places where it recedes
from the river-bed itself into the interior;
i. e. widens out. The interpretations of
Walther and Doed. appear also open to
serious objections.

10. tergum, sc. ‘ Germanorum.’ Duebn.
observes that· the description is that of a
pine wood; and the epithet ‘pura’ (‘ with-

out brushwood') seems taken from the ’

‘ purus campus’ of Vergil (Aen. 12, 771),
and Livy (24. 14, 6).
