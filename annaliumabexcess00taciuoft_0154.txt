136 INTRODUCTION.

lroutine duties for want of a trusted adviser at his side. Hence again the
>sense of isolation¹ redoubling his fears, and making him see a fresh
enemy at every turn, who must be struck down to make life safe to him.

He is, indeed, probably entitled to all the credit that has been claimed

for him, as throughout a just and liberal ruler of the ,provinces; the evi-
dence for which is by no means confined to the early period of his
principate. The temple founded in Asia in 776, Α. D. 23², the similar
request from Hispania Baetica in 778, A. D. 2 5⁸, appear genuine expres-
sions of gratitude for punishment of official oppression⁴; and it is
probably only because the latter application was refused, that more were
not forthcoming ¹⁵. Medal⁶ and statue⁷ alike attest the feeling of Asia
for his liberality after its ruinous earthquake; inscriptions in the pro-
vinces ⁸ and even in Rome ⁹ give him epithets by no means constantly
applied to princes in such documents.

But, after all, the heart of the empire was still the senate of Rome in
its relation to the prince: and if those who should have been the most
valued instruments of his administration are seen shrinking terror-strichen .
from the public service, and absorbed in the effort to save themselves ς
it is impossible that the general effect could have been other than
disastrous‚ Ι

If our other evidence were more questionable than it is, the decline of
literature would alone confirm it. Not but that even the Augustan age
is nearly stripped of literary genius, as the great spirits born and trained
under the Republic pass away, and the few survivors at the succession
of Tiberius attest by their position the change of times. The great
historian of Rome had, as it seems, abruptly closed his work, and retired
to his native Padua3 the only great living poet was pining in exile on the
Euxine. But from even the survival of such names it is indeed a descent,
to a generation in which Velleius and Valerius Maximus, the fables of
Phaedrus, and the rhetoxzieal writings of M. Seneca, make up all the
literature before us 1⁰; and in which there is little evidence of greater
