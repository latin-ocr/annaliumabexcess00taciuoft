1. prolabebantur. The metaphor (cp.
1. 31, 3; 2. 10, 23 4. 18, 2, etc.) is from
persons slipping their footing and unable
ω recover themselves. Drager compares

e municipiis et coloniis. The use
of these terms by Tacitus to denote spe-
cially the towns of Italy (see note on 1.
79, 1) makes the antithesis in ⁴ provinciis'
sufficiently plain, though the provinces
also contained towns of colonial or mu-
nicipal rank. That Tiberius himself had
sreely enrolled senators from Italian towns,
is stated in the speech of Claudius (Col.
ii. l. 2), who cites other precedents sor the
great extension which he recommends. In
822, A. D. 69, Otho (H. 1. 84, 6) calls the
senate ‘ decora omnium provinciarum?

‘provincialis parsimonia’ of Massilia is
mentioned in Agr. 4, 3.
