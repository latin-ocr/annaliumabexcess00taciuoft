planetary influenees but by natural causation. A more extreme, and
apparently more popular theory, to which Tacitus evidently inclines,

ξ would hold that our destiny is fixed from the moment of our birth, and

ξ could be foretold from our horoscope, were we sure of our interpreter ;

{but that the true professors are few, and the art discredited by the multi-

{tude of quacks.

Believing in astrology, he believed also in prodigies and omens1 as
means whereby the future was revealed; but here again he would say
that misinterpretations were rife ², and that many prognostications were
only recognised as such aster the event ⁸.

Elsewhere he often uses popular language in which fortune and destiny
are mingled and confused ⁴, and the latter appears osten to mean no more
than the operation of some inexplicable cause ⁵, or sometimes only that
which would happen in the ordinary course of nature if men made no
effort to Supersede it ⁶. When he has to explain the steady career and
position of a Manius Lepidus, he feels that it must be due not altogether
to destiny, but in part at least to his own personal qualities ⁷.

On the whole, his doctrine has thus neither the precision nor the
embarrassing consequences of a philosophical theory, and is rather such
as would be expected in one ,who held that, while a tincture of deeper
studies formed part of necessary culture ⁸, it was not well for a Roman
senator to go too far in them ⁹. His creed serves him at times to point
a moral, rather than affects his general view of historical events ¹⁰.

· Wn‘ting with a moral purpose, it is needless to say that Tacitus holds
himself bound to tell truth without prejudice or favour ¹¹. That he is no
careless follower of previously written narratIVes is shown by the places
where he corrects or supplements them from sources involving more
labour in verification, such as the ‘ acta senatus ' or ‘ populi 12ς’ while the

laccuracy in detail, both of himself and his informants, is in no slight
degree evidenced by confirmatory inscriptions, such as those already
