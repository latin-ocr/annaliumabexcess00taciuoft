Vitellius in editiora enisus eodem agmen subduxit. pernoctavere
sine utensilibus, sine igni, magna pars nudo aut mulcato corpore,
haud minus miserabiles quam quos hostis circumsidet: quippe

'lillic etiam honestae mortis usus, his inglorium exitium.

'submersam nec fides salutis, antequam Caesarem exercitumque

reducem videre.

from ‘agmen’ Individuals are spoken
of here, and whole ⁴ manipuli ' further on.

3. subtracto eolo, ‘ ut of de th}
Tacitus appears to takeffi& s, but
not the meaning, from Vergil (Aen. 5.
1 ).

994. vox et mutui hortatus. The
words are here joined closely in a hendi-
adys=·the voice of mutual encourage-

..ις’ πῚῖεῆῑς-*πεσᾚῖιὶῚΗἮῖξῐῖἦξιιὶεΙι

e former, as the word of command,
from the latter, as the encouragement of
comrades See note on c. 4, 1.

5. ab inprudenti. This correction of
Lips. sor the MS. ‘ aprudenti’ is supported
hythe occurrence of a similar error (‘ non
’ prudentem,’ for ‘ non inprudentem ') in
4. 7ο, 6. Some have here followed Wolf
in reading ‘ ab rudi : ’ but ‘ sapientes ⁹ is
ο posed to ‘inprudentissimi’ by Seneca
( pp. 14, 2 ; 90, 3303 also ‘sapientes' has
, the force of ‘prudentes’ in Agr. 27, 2,

and here corresponds to ‘ prudentes ’ in a

similar passage (2. 23, 2). The two

terms are here explained by ‘consilia'
and ‘casm' denoting the mode of action
of ns of each class.

. involvebantur, sc. ‘fluetibus;' so
‘auster aqua involvens navemque virum·
351 12⁷2&OE ἐζ ὃέξὲ, ῑὲὶχὶῖεὲἓὲ ἓ

The ·

‘ Hic ’ and ‘ ille ' are referred here to the
nearer and more remote objects of thought,
irrespective of the order of mention; as
in 6. 37, 23 H. 2. 77.. 43 4. 27, 3: cp.
‘huic’ Ann. 2. 77, 13 ‘ 1111 ‘ 2. 82, 7; and
note on c. 42, 6.

honestae mortis usus. ‘have the
resource of even honourable death: Cp.
'‘ bene morte usum ' 6. 48, 5.

lux, personified, as in Liv. 9. 30, 10,
⁴ lux . . . oppressit! See Introd.v. ξ 75.

1 1. reddidit, ‘ showed again ; ’ the tide
and flood having receded.

amnem [Visurgin] The proper
substitute sor this plainly wrong name is
uncertain. The reading of Ritter (⁸ ad
Amisiam ‘) supposes this chapter to de-
scribe part of the movement mentioned in
c. 63, 5 (⁶ reducto ad Amisiam exercitu’).
But we have here a movement not from
the interior, but along the coast, and
apparently occupying only two days and
a night. To make the ships more man-
ageable at sea, these two legions must
have been sent on from the naval rendez-
vous, at or near the mouth of the Ems, by
much the same route as the ‘ pars equitum·
(e. 63, 5); and must have been taken on
board at the mouth of another river
further on, perhaps left unnamed. The
conjecture ‘ Vidrum ’ (Lips.) is taken from
the Οὐίδρος of Ptol. 2, 11, ξ 1 (supposed
to be the Vecht, now falling into the
Zuider Zee) ; ⁴ Unsingim ' is imagined by
Alting as a Latin name sor the Hunse.
which suits the geography best.

14. reducem, sing ; the principal object
of thought being Caesar: cp. 12. 12, 3.
