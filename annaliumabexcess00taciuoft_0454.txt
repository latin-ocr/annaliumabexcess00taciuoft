1. Leptitanos. Lep tis minor (Lamta.
or Lamba), a free city pbetween Thapsus
and Hadrumetum, is here meant; Lep tis
maior (Lebdah) being east of Tripoli, and
beyond what can reasonably be supposed
to be the field of operations.

suffugia Garamantum, ‘places οἱ
retreat among the Garamantes' -(cp. 4.
47, 2; G. 16, 4, ete.): the word is used
in post· -Augustan prose andin Ovid. The
Garamantes are generally placed m Fez-
zan, which is certainly far nearer Leptis

‘maior ’than‘ minor, ’but they may have
extended further westward.

2. Cirtensium, Cirta, the chief town.
of Numidia or New Africa, restored by
Constantine under his own name, · which
is still borne by the modern city, the
capital os the Freynch province.

traherentur, ‘should be plunderedt’

cp. ‘Aeduorum pagos trahebat’ H. 2. 61,
2. Th e use appears taken from Sall.
(letter of Mithridates) H. 4. 61, 17 D, 19
K, p. 15 5 G.

3. Blaesus filius: see on 1. 19, 4.

5. quoquo inclinarent, subjunct. ex-
pressing frequent occurrence: cp. Introd.

v.§52.

ι. in ore= ‘in conspectu: ' cp ‘in ore

vulgi' H 3. 36, 1.

10. veteris, Africa proper as distinct
from Numidia, now held with it: cp. note
onuzt 51121 hmine belli, ‘as being close
to the seat of war2' cp. ‘ut in civili bell'o’

H. 2. 34, 13 and other such causal uses ’
of‘ ut‚' given in Introd. ν. 567. There .
seems to be no sufficient reason for omit· ⁴
ting it (with Nipp.). J
rI. mutantem anamiim adapted, like ⁴

112’ are mentioned by Livy (29. 31) apiid ¹⁷
described by Vergil (G. 3, 331— 334), and, -·
according to Shaw (Τ12ν615, i. p. 397), ¹,
answer to the ‘hhymas' or ‘beet- el· shar’ J-
(‘ houses of hair’ ), the goatskin tents, in ῃ
shape like an inverted boat, of the Bedo- ⁷
weens. Sallust, who thus describes their 3
shape <Jug. 1 8, 8), 02115 them ‘aedificia,’ap- ΣΙ.
parently confounding them with such huts ·
as are spoken of (‘arundine texta storea· ³
que. tecta ') in Liv. 30. 3, 93 which ’
according to Shaw (p. 400) answer to the
gurbies’ (of hurdleps daubed with mu& 1 3·
or of sunbaked clay and thatch) used by 1²²
the Kabyles; supposed by him to be the ’ ‘2
‘magalia’ of Vergpil (Aen.y 1, 421). Both J*
words are used for the single tent or hut, J <
and for collections os them (the ‘douwars’ ξ
of the former, ⁶ dashkrahs’ of the latter ᾗ
class).
15. id quoque, i. e. besides the‘trium· sj
halia? ’Ἴ ’
p 16. priseo. h.0n0re. Livy (27. 19, 4)
represents Scipio Africanus as saying that J
he had this title from his soldiers; and 5³?
it is found on some inscriptions nearlyf-
approaching that time: see Mommsen«.
