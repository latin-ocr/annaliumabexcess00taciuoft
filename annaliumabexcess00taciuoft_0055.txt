THE SVNTAX AND STVLE OF TACITUS. 37

   

21. 'Phe dative after compound verbs, where accus. with prep. ⁸
would be usual, is also poetical, as pectori adcreverat 1. 29, 1 (where
¹ see note) ; penatibus induxerit 5. 1, 3, etc.

> 22. Dative of work contemplated. Roby 1156, 1383.

(α) Gerund. Such expressions as restaurando sufficeret 3. 72, 4 3
ἷ testificando vulgabat 13. 11, 2 (cp. 15. 16, 2); appear to be exten-
' sions of the classical phrases solvendo esse, scribendo adesse. Dr.
ι· § 206.
¹ (b) Gerundive. It is characteristic of Tacitus to employ this usage
’ with increasing, and latterly with great frequency: only three instances
f being found in the minor works, and thirteen in the Histories‚ while it
l abounds in the Annals. It is used with more than twenty adjectives (see
1. 23, 53 37, 1 3 2. 57, 3, etc.), and much oftener with verbs; often so
as to be fully equivalent to a final clause: e, g. with deligere 2. 4, 1, etc.;
digredi 11. 32, 23 eximere 3. 22, 63 immittere 11. 1, 13 mittere 1. 60,
2, etc.; praemittere 15. 10, 6; venire 6. 43, 3, etc. Dr. § 206 B,
Wfflfflin (Phil. 25. 114), Madvig 415, Obs. 2. Compare the genitive
Α below, § 37.

(c) Apparently by an extension of such an usage as ‘ receptui canere‚'
a simple dative is used with transitive or often with intransitive verbs,
with the force osa final clause ,· as morti deposcit 1. 23, 6; incessit itineri
et praelio 1. 51, 4 ; factum est senatus-consultum ultioni iuxta et securi-

Α 'tati 13. 32, 1. For other instances, see Dr. ξ 52, Nipp. on 1. 51.

23. 'I'he dative expressing that which a thing (or person) serves
ᾗ aa or occasions, or predicative dative (Roby 1158), most frequent in
the case of forms in ‘-ui‚’ and especially used with the verb esse, is
,ζ’ common in Tacitus. Roby has collected (Pref. xxv—lvi) a list of about
180 words so used by writers not later than Suetonius, of which thirty-
f} eight are used by Tacitus, about five by him alone. It is still more
' “3 characteristic, that out of only eleven instances collected of the use of such
ζ a dat. in apposition, eight are from Tacitus, who thus uses usui and
’ ostentui twice (Ann. 11. 14, 53 H. 3.⁴20, 63 Ann.12.14, 63 H. 1. 78, 1),
Ι and dehonestamento, documento, obtentui, subsidio once each (12. 14,
’Β 63 15. 27, 23 H. 2. 14, 65 12. 29, 2). On the distinction between this
ζ’ dat. and that in § 22, see Roby 1. 1.

    
  

C. ABLATIVE.

“large islands (Roby 12 58), is not unclassical (though styled a solecism in

24. 'l'he ablativo of place whence, which, as used of countries or ,
