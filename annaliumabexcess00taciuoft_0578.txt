by Horace (Od. 3. 29, 273 Sat. 2. 6, 38)

p. 708. Agrippa shared his duties for a
time (Dio, 51. 3, 10), and afterwards had
a similar τῆς πόλεως διαχείρισις in 733,

original jurisdiction seems little more than
such as had been exercised by the ‘ tresviri
capitales’ at the Maenian column (Cic.
Div. in Caec. 16, 50, etc.); but it must
have been soon emended, and the urban
cohorts, the ‘proprius miles' (H. 3. 64,
1) of the praefect, must have existed
before the death of Augustus (see note on
1. 8, 3). In the time of Nero an appa-
rent clash of his jurisdiction with that of
the praetor is mentioned (14. 41, 2); and
in later times the office became far more
important: see Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p.
