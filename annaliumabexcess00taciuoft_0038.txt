every type of character conspicuously displayed3 and may hence take
models for yourself and your country to imitate, or instances of what is
vile in its beginning and issues, to avoid ¹.'

Side by side with this runs another, but a closely connected purpose,
to be the means of teaching a political wisdom suitable to the times. He
reminds the reader, that as men had of old to study the tempers of the
aristocracy or the people, so, under a virtual monarchy, even the appar-
ent trifles which he collects and puts on record will have their use, as
men learn what is advantageous or pernicious more readily from the
examples of others than from any forethought of their own 2.

This·purpose, though apparently. less-exanedthanjheuother, aims no
less in result at elevating the character of public men. For the lesson
which he desires to teach is that ‘ even under bad princes there can be

i good citizens ⁸15 and that the most admirable is generally also the most

successful; neither the base courtier who, by any reacfion, or even by
the mere desire for a new instrument ⁴, is unmade in 3 moment by the
breath that made him, nor the proud and impracticable ‘irreconcileable‚’
like Helvidius Priscus, who ostentatiously flings away his life⁵, but the
dignified reserve and moderationf removed alike from perilous disrespect
and loathsome servility,’ which sustained the position of a Manius Lepidus
under Tiberius& a Memmius Regulus under N ero and an Agricola
under Domitian8 .

It is with these purposes that we are to suppose him to have dealt
with his materials 3 on these that his sense of historical proportion, in the
topics made more or less prominent or wholly omitted, may be taken to
be mainly grounded ⁹. Even granting the defects incident to history
thus written for a purpose; his aim and range of subject elevate his
work above mere biographies‚ such as those of Suetonius. Much as all ,
history at such a time must dwell on the personal qualities of the prince,
he has never made these his subject in themselves ; but always in some
subordination to their effect on the personal government and administra·
tion of the empire. The designation of his work by Jerome, as ‘ Lives .
of the Caesars ¹⁰,’ needs but to be mentioned, to show its entire inadequacy.

Yet again, the purpose in view alone justifies to himself, andis expected
to justify to the reader, the monotony of his theme3 the weary record of 3
‘cruel mandates, perpetual accusations‚ treacherous friendships, destruc-
