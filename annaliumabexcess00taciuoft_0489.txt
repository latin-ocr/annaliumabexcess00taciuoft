Augustus (Suet. Aug. 35). It was un-

i 3. perinde quam: so most edd. (cp.

² MS. ‘proinde' but in all the passages of
i Tacitus referred to by him the reading is

is a Plautine usage (Truc. 2. 3, 3), and
1 noh phrases as ‘proinde ac’ (Lucr. 3,
1035, 105 3) are analogous.

praetorian guard were not sully armed

1 2. atrocius vero, ⁴ too atrocious to be
true? Nipp. notes from Miiller that this
use of the comparative, not strictly paral-
lel to ‘ minora . . . maiora vero’ (H. ι.
29, 1; 2. 70, 4), answers more to those
in which it denotes a disproportion, as
‘onus . . . animis et . . . corpore maius’
(Hor. Ep. 1. 17, 39), ‘curatio altior fas-
tigio suo ‘ (Liv. 2. 27, 6), or to those in
which the comparative is followed by
‘quam,' with an ellipse of some such
words as ⁴ esse solet' (cp. H. 1. 22, 1; 3.
7, 2). The expression here might thus
be taken as an abbreviation for ⁸ atrocius
quam quod verum esse solet.’

13. neque peractus, ‘ his trial was not
carried out;' the strict sense of ‘reum
peragere' <Liv. 4. 42, 6. etc), which is
sometimes merely equivalent to ‘accu-
sare.'

14. opportunam: cp. Liv. 6. 1, 7 ‘ iu-
dicio eum mors adeo opportuna ut volun-
tariam magna pars crederet, subtraxit.'
The same suggestion appears to be im-
plied here.

15. orandi validus. On the genitive,
see Introd. v. 33 εγ. Severus is spoken
of as the introducet of the new style of
oratory gDial. 19, 1, cp. Introd. v. p. 30),
