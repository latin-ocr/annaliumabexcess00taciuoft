‘ 1. suffragium ad honores, i. e. that he

, would ‘commend’ him. Fulcinius be-

came ultimately consul in 784, A. D. 31
(5. 11, 1).

3. in ulciscenda . . . morte. Halm
considers it necessary, here and in 6. 32, 6
(see note there), to insert the preposition,
which is absent in the MS. Such a
simple ablative could only by a forced
explanation be called quasi-instrumental
(see Nipp. and Drager), and the reference
to ⁸ explenda simulatione' (14. 4, 8) is to
a questionable parallel, as are also those
given by Pfitzner (p. 103), t'o ‘ dissi-
*mulando metu’ (11. 32, 23 15. 69, 2).

non modo . . . etiam: in 4. 35, 1
’ sed’ is similarly omitted, as is ‘ etiam’
in 1. 60, 1, etc„ and perhaps both in
G. 10, 5 ‘ non solum apud plebem, apud
ffiffffiffid {i{e¹3<?.}{²{.t(lsshssffet<‚⁵5?
mul-ly somewhat strengthened by these
e ipses.

4. agebant: cp. 1. 4, 4: 68, 1. The
nse of this verb absolutely, for ⁶ vivere'
or ‘degere‚' is very common in Tacitus
(e-g· 4· 28, ,u 13- 45, 4; 15- 74, 4, etc.)-
but otherw1se apparently confined to
Sallust (Jug. 55, ²3 89, 7, etc.).

5. iactata, ‘discussedz’ so in H. 4. 8,
6, ete.; also Caes. B. G. 1. 18, 13 Liv. 1.
50, a ; 10. 46, 16, etc.

6. dum, ‘inasmuchasz' cp. 2.88‚4,ete.

7. utrumque, credulity and salsifim-
tion, the habit of mind of the two classes of
:persons compared.

7. posteritate. The construction ap-
pears to be that of an ablative of time,
like ‘ secutis temporibus ’ above.

8. repetendis auspiciis. Supposing
him to have had ‘ proconsulare imperium ’
(see on 1. 14, 5); it must have been only
‘extra urbem’ (cp. 12. 41, 2), as distinct
from that of the princeps, which did not
cease within the pomoerium. More pro-
perly, the general is said ‘repetere aus-
picia' at Rome itself (cp. Liv. 8. 30, 2;
Mommsen, Staatsr. i. p. 96).

8. ovans introiit. An inscription
(Henzen 6443) gives the date as v. k.
Jun. (May 28).

9. Vipsania: see on 1. 12, 6. In what
follows, the children of Agrippa by Mar-
cella (Introd. ix. note 19) appear to be
ignored ; and, of the others, Julia, though
dying in exile, and thus hardly ‘miti
obitu,' is not stated (4. 71, 6) to have
died by violence.

12. priore aestate. These words are
bracketed by Nipp. as an interpolation,
and are certainly an error; as the cam-
paign of Camillus is given as having
taken place in 770, A. D. 17 (2. 52).
Ritter has suggested that the words may
mean ‘ in a former summer,’ but Tacitus
would hardly give so vague a reference.

15. Pagyda. It is suggested by Dueb-
ner, that this may be the river Abeadh, in
the district of Constantine; but we have
no other mention of it.

1 6. eohortem Romanam, apparently a
legionary cohort: cp. 1. 60, 2.
