CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLV PRINCIPATE. 83

might even be dangerous, for not every heir could so be trusted ¹. ‘ Pro-
consulare imperium’ seems indeed capable of degrees, and was given to
Germanicus ², probably to Drusus³‚ probably also to Seianus ⁴, in a lower
form than the full ‘ consortium ’ held by Tiberius ⁵ with Augustus. The
tribunitian power seems to be treated as more significant, and is shared
still more span‘ngly 3 with Augustus only by Agrippa and Tiberius, with
Tiberius only by Drusus ⁶ ; never again, till shared by Titus with
Vespasian ⁷ : and even Tiberius, when first admitted to share that power,
must have felt that others stood nearer to the succession than he.

But whatever the position of the expectant successor, the formal choice ἱ
lay with the senate, and its ratification with the comitia ⁸, and the powers ’ =
were again defined at each succession ⁹. In any case, the principate is ἶ,
no monarchy in which ‘ the king never dies ; ' there is always an interval,-
during which its character as an excrescence of the revolution reappears‚
in that no ‘interrex’ is needed as if the republic had been left without
chief magistrates„ The competence of the consuls still survives ; to them
a living princeps can pretend ¹⁰, or even offer¹¹ to resign 3 and at his
death they carry on government during the interval ¹², and the form of the
constitution is still complete.

The senate again at these epochs may assert itself by ‘ condemning the
memory¹³' of the dead, whether by omitting his name from the list of
precedents in the ‘lex’ of his successor ¹⁴, or by the milder ἀτιμία of
refusing deification¹⁵. Among other formidable ‘ secret principles of the
constitution ' revealed in 821, Aa). 68, was also this, that the senate could
even unmake and outlaw a living princeps, through the old formula,

invoked by Tiberius against his own natural heirs¹⁵, of declaring him a
public enemy ¹⁷. '

Without doubt the early principes owed much of the stability of their
