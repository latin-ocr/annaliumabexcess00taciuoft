NOTES. STEM A. 145

‘Germanicus’ with the titles of pontifex and quaestor (Henzen, Insc.
5396), to which offices he was elected in 784 and 786, A.n. 31 and 33
(Dio, 58. 8, 1; 23, 1). As princeps he retains the name of Germanicus,
after that of Augustus (Insc. Orell. 702). After his first marriage with Junia
Claudilla, daughter of M. Silanus (6. 20, 13 Suet. Cal. 12), he had as
wives Livia Orestilla and Lollia Paulina, before Caesonia (Suet. Cal. 25).
The assassination of Gaius was followed immediately by that of Caesonia
and her child (Suet. Cal. 59).

14. A (16). Agrippina was born at ‘ Oppidum Ubiorum’ (12. 27, 1),
and her birthday is preserved in an Arval Table. The year is fixed by
Mommsen (see note 8) from other dates. On her marriage to Cn. Domitius
(36) in 781, Α.11. 28, see 4. 75, 1. On her banishment by Gaius in 792, A.D.
39, and recall by Claudius in 794, A.D. 41, see Dio, 59. 22, 83 60. 4, 1 ;
for her second husband Crispus Passienus, see on 6. 20, 2 ; on her
marriage to her uncle Claudius, in 802, A. D. 49, and subsequent history,
see 12. 5, etc. In earlier inscriptions she is styled ‘Agrippina,' or ‘ Iulia
Agrippina, Germanici Caesaris filia' Orell. 671, 67 3); but after 803, A.D.
5ο (see 12. 26, 2), she is styled on coins and inscriptions ‘Agrippina
Augusta,' or ‘ Iulia Augusta Agrippina.' Henzen‚ Insc. 5387.

15. A (17). The dates of birth of Agrippina and Julia seem to show
the statement of Suet. (Cal. 7), that the three sisters were born in three
successive years, to be only approximately true. Drusilla must have been
born before the triumph (2. 4 1, 2), and probably in Germany. Her marriage
to L. Cassius took place in 786, Aa). 33 (6. 15, 4). She was afterwards
ι married to M. Lepidus (Dio, 59. 11, 1. See A, note 12). In inscrip-
tions during her life she is styled ‘Iulia Drusilla Germanici f.’ (Insc.
Orell. 671), but afterwards ‘Diva Drusilla' (Orell. 6743 Henzen 5389),
in consequence of the divine honours decreed by order of Gaius at her
death in 791, A.n. 38. Suet. Cal. 243 Dio, 59. 11.

16. A (18). Julia is so called by Tacitus, by Dio, and on a coin
(Eckhel, vi. p. 2 31); but this name is borne by all the three sisters (see
notes 14, 15) ; and Suetonius distinguishes her from them as Livilla (Cal. 7).
Each name is supported by inscriptions, as ‘Iuliae Germanici Caesar. filiae,
and ‘Livilla Germanici f.' (Insc. Orell. 676, 677). Tacitus gives the
date of her birth and the place (Lesbos) 2. 54, 1 ; and the date of her
marriage to L. Vinicius (786, A. D. 33), 6. 15, 1. She shared the banish-
ment and recall of Agrippina (note 13), but was soon after again banished
and put to death at the instigation of Messalina, Dio, 60. 8, 5. Sue-
tonius (Cal. 7) mentions the death in childhood of three other children of
Germanicus and Agrippina, born apparently in the years 761—764, A.D.
¹ 8‘-11; and inscriptions are found recording the place of their cremation.
