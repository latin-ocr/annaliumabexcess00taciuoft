with ‘ in,' is found in Caes.,Cic., and Sall.,
but is uncommon: cp. H. 4. 45, 2.
1. deerevere . . . templum. On this

2 in which the temple &as to stand had
ᾗ yet to be determined (cp. c. 55. 56.)
2. statuere. The inf. is used with
¹ ‘pumislium (est)’ in c. 48, 2; G. 7, 2,
and in the best authors. Similar permis-
ἐστι was refused to Spain (c. 37).
’ Nero. Youths of the imperial family
often thus acted as ‘ patroni ’ of the pro-
2 finees: cp. 12. 58, 1. ει
5. principe viro: cp. 3. 6, 5 ; 34, 11.
7. Servi Maluginensis: see 3. 58; 71.
9. perficies. This restriction applied
{anthe ‘rex ‘sacrificu'ffils' ansl the three
mines maiores. e ‘ minores ’ were
at this time mostly obsolete: cp. Mar-
* nardt, Staatsv. iii. p. 314, and, on ‘con-
ζ tio,’1d. p. ²92· Not only was the
fltmen required to be born of parents
mmcd by this form, but, as duties were
’ migned to the ‘flaminica,' he was re-
to have a wife, and also to have
married to her by the same rite.
ξ ¹ trem . . nominari, etc. It appears
dar that the final choice rested with the
chief pontiff, who was said ‘capere fla-
* minem' ·(Liv. 27. 8, 5). The preliminary
nummation of three may have been made
Κ δ] the senate (instead of the comitia) or
by the college of the pontiffs.
Ἴ ..12 pluresque, etc. Halm follows Mad-
ξ m2(Adv. Crit. ii. p. 546) in placing this
sentence in ae psarpntlggsipgkwhereby the
whole passag ο en as wag
ΝΘ reasons for the scarcity of {andi-

 

dates: the first being that few were born
of ⁶ confarreati parentes‚' the second, that
the loss of ‘ patria potestas ’ was objected
to. The parenthetical sentence gives two
explanations of the first cause, namely,
natural negligence of a cumbrous cere-
mony, and deliberate avoidance of its ac-
companying impediments.

13. penes incuriam. Nipp. compares
this use of ‘penes’ with Hor. A. P. 71
(‘ usus, quem penes,‘ ete), where, as in
H. 1. 57, 4, some personification seems
implied, while here a quality belonging
to persons is spoken of.

accedere. The MS. has ‘accederet‚‘
with a point under ‘t‚’ whence Jac. Gron.
reads ‘ accedere et.’

ipsius caerimoniae difficultate&
Such a marriage could only be dissolved
by the equally cumbrous process of ⁶ dif-
farreatio,' and Romans now praetised di-
vorce with the utmost freedom.

14. et quod. The MS. has ‘qu6,’ usu-
ally taken here, as in other places, sor
‘quoniam;’ others, with Beroald., read
‘quando ; ‘ Halm's adoption of ‘quod ' is
supported by ‘quo’ being written for
‘ quod ' in c. 39, 4. Nipp.‚ who accepts
‘quoniam' as the right reading of the
MS„ thinks it can only be explained on
the supposition that several words or

1.)

sentences have been lost, which on other ·

grounds is certainly probable. It is evi-
dent that the office must have been in
itsels undesirable, owing to the severe
mles imposed on its occupant (cp. 3, 71.
and the long list enumerate-d in Gell. 10,
15), and we should expect to find this
fact mentioned, as also the quarter indi-
