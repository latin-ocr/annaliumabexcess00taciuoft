132 INTRODUCTJON.

neglect and disorder; ambassadors and suitors were unable to get
a hearing¹; even the ‘album iudicum’ is no longer filled up² 3 the
best men hang back from public service³ or are kept for years from
going to the province nominally entrusted to them⁴; others are left
year after year at their posts with apparent indifference to their merits3
whether they were judicious‚ as Poppaeus Sabinus ⁵, cruel and oppressive,
as Pontius Pilate⁶‚ or contumacious and dangerous, as Gaetulicus ⁷.
Even the senatorial provinces, as Asia and Africa, seem to feel the
effects of the general irregularity⁸; and even the security of the frontier
is said to be no longer fully maintained ⁹.

Some apparent taint of insanity seems to come in, completing and
partly explaining the whole: perhaps traceable sometimes in the clear
evidence of public documents-; as in the attempt, in his published auto-
biography‚ to explain the condemnation of Seianus by a salsehood of
childish transparency ¹⁰; or in the famous words preserved'of his letter to
the senate, publishing to the world his agony of soul ¹¹! Again, at one
time reproach seems to lacerate him ¹², at another he parades it1³ ; he hovers
round and round Rome and never enters it 14; shifts his place restlessly
in the last stage of decrepitude¹⁵. It is of little moment to decide be-
tween various reports of his end, or to know exactly how the last few
sands ran out of a life that to any good purpose had been extinct for
years.

As a set off against the judgment of Tacitus has been often sought in
the contemporary panegyric of Tiberius by Velleius ¹⁶, a few remarks
upon it appear here necessary. This writer’s means of information are
indeed unquestionable ¹⁷3 but his burst of courtly rhetoric, over even the
slightest service of his hero, takes away credit from his record of more
substantial achievements‚ even when described by him as an eye-witness
When, for instance, we are given to suppose that Tiberius at the age of
