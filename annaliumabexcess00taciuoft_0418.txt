1. nihil in exercitibus, Not only the
auxiliary forces, but to a great extent the
legions, had come to be recruited from
the provinces (see Introd. vii. p. 108).
The ‘urbana plebes’ had been drafted
into the ranks on emergency (cp. 1. 31,

4;) but the old Italian recruiting grounds
of the Republic now, ‘vix seminario exi-
guo militum relieto’ (Liv. 6. 12, 3), barely
served to keep up the praetorian and ur-
ban cohorts (4. 5, 5). ’

4. Andecavi ac Turoni. These an-
swer to the provinces of Anjou, on the
right of the lower Loire, and Touraine‚
on both sides of that river, above it. Their
capitals, Angers and Tours, are known
from the time of Ptolemy (2. 8, 8, 14) as
Juliomagus and Caesarodunum.

5. Acilius Aviola. He was then lega-
tus of Gallia Lugdunensis; and was after-
wards cos. suff. (Marquardt, i. p. 122). He
is thought by Nipp. not to be the consu-
lar of that name, mentioned by Val. Max.
(1. 8, 12) and Pl. mai. as a signal in-
stance of suspended animation; but the
gather of the consul of 807, A. D. 54 (12.

4,1)

cohorte. The ‘cohors xiii. urbana’
(see on 4. 5, 5) is mentioned in inscrip-
tions (e.g. Henzen 6808) as at Lug du-
num (Lyons), then the capital, andg the
town from whence the province is named.
Ῑη H. 1. 64, 6 the eohort there seems
wrongly written as the eighteenth.

6. legionario milite. This force
would appear from (c. 46, 3) to have

been a single legionary cohort ,· but see
note there.

Visellius Varro. C. Visellius C.
f. C. n. Varro, cos. 765, A.D. 12, with
Germanicus (Orell. Insc. 4717, etc.),
father of the consul of 777, A D. ²4 (4.
19,1). He m ist have succeeded to Cae-
cina Severus (1. 31, 2, etc.).

alam equitum. The ‘ala Treve
rorum’ is mentioned in 822, A. D. 69 (H f
2. 14, 2; 4. 55, 1), ‘ala equitumTreviro· ³
rum’ in a Rhenish inscription (see Orelli τ
