in Tacitus, see Introd. v. 5 7.

1. humani divinique imis sciens.
Nerva is similarly described in 6. 26, 1,
and, as jurisprudence is defined to be
‘ divinarum atque humanarum rerum no-
titia' (Ulp. Dig. 1. 1, 10), a great jurist
would be versed in both branches. Ma-
crobius (7. 13, 1 1) especially credits Capito
with proficiency in pontifical, or divine,
law. See Marquardt, Staatsv. iii. p. 304,

,ei-'gregium publicum. The analogy
of ‘ bonum,’ ‘malum,' ‘ optimum‚' ‘ pessi-
mum publicum ’ suggests that ‘egregium'
is here to be taken asthe substantive
(cp. 6.,24‚ 3; 14. 60, 1). In 4. 6, 2 ‘in-
lustres domi artes’ are contrasted with
‘ claritudo militiae,' as comprising all ac-
complishments whose renown could be
gained at home, those of the jurist, orator,
or man of letters. In this place the con-
trast seems rather to resemble that in 1.
13, 1 ‘ artibus egregiis et pari fama pub-
lice ; ’ juristic learning being viewed as an
accomplishment of private life (‘domi ⁵),
i. e. unconnected with any public office,

⁴ and thus contrasted with the ‘egregium

publicum' of Capito, his distinction in
the state as a consular and leading sena-
tor. Or, is it be thought that these
words must be taken, on the analogy of
‘bonum publicum‚' etc„ to mean ‘the
honour of the state,' we still need not
refer the expression, with Nipp.‚ to the
glory of the imperial clemency, which
Capito could hardly be said ‘dehones-
tare,’ but may take it of the renown
which so great a jurist had himself con-
ferred on his country.

from the fact that a temple thus entitled l
