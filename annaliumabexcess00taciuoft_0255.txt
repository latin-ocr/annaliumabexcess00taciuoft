deliguntur legiones, etc. The
same legions are similarly disposed in c.
51, 5. The variation of expression, both
in the subject forms and in those denoting
the action, is noted by Wolfflin (Philol.

Ἴ with the Ciceronian symmetry of such

periods as ⁶ studium . . . inlustrius ' (Dial.
numerare' (G.

6. inquies: cp. c. 68, 1, etc. The
word is first found in Sall„ thence passing
to Vell. and Pl. mai. Within these few
lines four poetical words are noted,
⁸ sonui-,¹ ‘ resulto? ‘ oberro,' and ‘ pervigil; '
the first of which is one of those in-
troduced into prose by Tacitus (see In-
uod, v. ς 70).

mnng its usual regularity and prompt-
nese. On the omission of ‘ essent,' cp.
c. 7, 1.

9. adimerent vallo. In 4. 48, 5,

’munitionibus adiacerent’ is used of

ἓξὲξ» listless from negligence, as here
despondency.

ιο. dira quies. Taken apparently from

12. 13, 3; 16. 1, 1), the word can always
bear its usual meaning; the dream by
which the rest is accompanied being in-
dicated by the epithet or context. But in
the twice repeated line of Vergil, ‘ Par
levibus ventis, volucrique simillima som-
no’ (Aen. 2, 7943 6, 702), ‘ somnus’
stands for the dream itself.

1 1. paludibus emersum. On the abl„
see Introd. v. §- ²4· Thus Sallust has
‘navigia fundo emergunt’ (H. 4. 22 D,
37 K, 17 G), but Livy ‘ ex . . . palude
emersus' (1. 13, 4).

12. manum intendentis reppulisse,
‘ thrust aside his hand as he held it out
to him.’ Usually ‘manum intendere’ ex·
presses a hostile gesture, as 4. 3, 2, etc.

1 3. coepta luce. On the use of this verb
in Tacitus, see Introd. v. § 42 b.

14. eampo umentia. ultra. This would

appear not to be the ‘ planities ¹ (e. 64, 7)>

bordering
pied by the enemy, which they were in-
tended to occupy so as to hold him in
check; but another solid spot, on the
further side of the morass: the occupatiori
of which left the baggage, struggling
along by way of the causeways through
marshy ground, exposed.

16. caeno fossisque. Nipp. rightly
takes these as abl„ as also ⁴ criminibus
haerebant’ (4. 19, 5). Cp. ‘haeret pede
pes’ (Verg. Aen. 10, 361) ; ‘ currus illuvie
haerebant' (Curt.8, 4) : see note on c. 68,
3. In earlier prose we should have ex-
