    

TACJTUS’ USE OF HIS MATERJALS. 23

>'c'ited¹; and by the paucity and insignificance of such errors of fact as
ἓ have been clearly brought home to him ². What is probably the weakest
point in his narrative, the want of precision in its geography ³, is a defect
³ which he shares with Livy, Sallust, and other authors who have had to
describe military movements on an extensive scale without the aid of
ff maps‘.

Two points may here be noted, in which this obligation to veracity
is consciously relaxed.

Firstly‚ in the account of battles, at least of disastrous battles‚ he con-
siders it a point of patriotism to conceal the number of Roman slain. 1
This reticence, observable throughoutv his narrative, especially in the
account of the campaigns of Germanicus, appears to have been delibe-
rately adopted as a principle, and grounded on precedent, in a lost part

of the Histories ⁵.

The second exception relates to the practice, so common among
2, ancient historiam, and never regarded by them as a breach of
ἶ attath, of composing imaginary speeches purporting to be historicam
5 There is, however, reason to believe that Tacitus recognised some liinit
Ξ in this respect, as may be seen by comparing the speech assigned to
Claudius dn the concession of full citizenship to the Gauls⁶ with the
extant fragments of the actual speech ⁷. These fragments appear to form
{⁴ part osa lengthy and tedious harangue 3 that in Tacitus is a single chapter,
not without trace of the pedantry of the original, though elevated by his
‘dignified and nervous style. Still the following sentenceS, if taken out·
’,ι of their order, condense the substance of the first column and the begin-

ning of the second, and perhaps supply a link between them—

’Δ ‘ Omnia P. C. quae nunc vetustissima creduntur, nova fuere. Advenae in
s nos regnaverunt. plebeii magistratus post patricios, Latini post plebeios,
ceterarum Italiae gentium post Latinos!

. The following sentence expresses no less faithfully some of the latter
J pan of the second column—-

‘Ac tamen, si cuncta bella recenseas, nullum breviore spatio quarn

adversus Gallos confectum; continua inde ac fida pax.'
