CHARACTER ΛΝΒ GOVERNME'NT OF TIBERIUS. 121

'ss of Augusta ¹, and he could hardly be passed over in the award of pro-

vinces. Itis reasonable to suppose that the one mistrust was set against

the other, that he was to be some check on his young ‘imperator ²,' who,
in turn, was to check him by· an ‘ imperium maius ’ on the spot. Such a
view is consistent with the belief that the full extent to which such rivalry.

a might be pushed was not foreseen. Nor need a word here be said on
. 2 any insinuation of the complicity of Tiberius in a death ascribed by the

V superstitious to witchc'raft, and by those who dispensed with evidence to
¹ poisoning ³ : still less on the imagination apparently for a moment enter-

” tained by Tacitus that the really fatal charge against Piso, that of levying
2 civil war in the province, was somehow the outcome of a deep-laid plot

We pass to the state trials, especially those for ‘ maiestas,’ the one point
excepted in the summary ⁵ from the generally just administration of laws
dun'ng this period.

Tacitus is himself our best authority as to the offences originally and
subsequently made indictable under this term⁶; which appears to have
been gradually defined, with increasing width, by the ‘ leges’ ‘ Appuleia '
(654, 13.c. 100), ‘ Varia' (663, Β. c. 91), ‘ Cornelia ' (during therule of
Sulla), and ‘ Iulia’ (enacted by. Augustus) 3 and which, even in the time
of Cicero, has a formidably elastic meaning, which would hardly require
pressing to make it cover offensive words ⁷. ffhis application is, how-s

ever, at least extremely limited ⁸ until the time of Tiberius, under whom it

is extended even to spoken words ⁹ z and the strict limitation to libels on

’ the prince himself and his parent ¹⁰ is disregarded in practice ¹¹.

During this first period, about twelve trials ¹2 may be noted, in which
this is either the sole charge, or more frequently coupled with others ¹³.
In two cases acts are alleged, which in any age would have been treason-
able-¹¹, ifproved; in the othegthe charge is grounded either on a more or
less strained interpretation of acts, or, in one or two cases, on words ¹⁵.

It should be added, that in three cases the charge of ‘ maiestas ' is dis-
