ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. 111

    

‚ - ieal order was connected with the sacred ideas of domestic security; not
only in Rome and Italy, but 1n many parts of the empire. ¹ To this was
ἐξ added afterwards throughout the empire the later cult of the‘ Divus
3} Augustus2’ and his deified successors; as also 1n some cases, that of the
ς’ living Caesar, associated with the imperial city³: the whole forming a

, kind of apotheosis of order and peace, which appears to have been sor

v the present the nearest approach to an universal religion.

Otherwise there was more interchange than fusion of manifold reli-

,⁴ gions. Temples to Jupiter‘Capitolinus are found in provinces4 3 and, in

turn, whatever was attractive in provincial religions struck root in Rome ;

¹ and supplied, what the colder forms of the state ritual failed to supply,

,T¹ some food for the fervour of religions enthusiasm and for speculative

’ theology. Many foreign religions obtained special licence, and even the

’ἶ illicit might enjoy practical impunity, till circumstances pointed attention

to them3 as in the suppression of Isiac rites by Agrippa⁵ ; or the stern
vengeance taken by Tiberius on the priests of this cult for a flagrant

moral scandal⁶3 or the deportation of Jews arising out of a gross pecu-
niary fraud⁷ ε the penalty being apparently in neither case such as sensibly
’ἡ to abate the prevalence of such worships.
’ Νοι· could any coercion keep out the forbidden mysteries of astrology
and—magief· the former of which had the direct countenance of Tibe-
chough his protection of Thrasyllus⁹ did not interfere with the
chastisement of the meaner herd ¹⁰. The influence of all foreign super-
·stitions on a less strong mind may be seen in the case of Germanicus ;
· in the restless search after foreign oracles, worships, miracles ¹¹, which
seems to have so far guided his movements in the East; and in the
belief shared by his friends as well as himself, that the magician was as
capable of causing his death as the poisoner ¹².

Meanwhile, the only religion capable of taking the place both of the
{effete ideas of old Roman worship, and of the gross fanaticisms of foreign

{supersutmm was known as yet only to a few poor Jews, and hardly
