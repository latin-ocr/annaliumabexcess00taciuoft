most instances have followed the MSS.

1. abstitit. This is generally read,
aster Lips.‚ sor the MS„ ‘adstitit,’ the
death being more a reason why the sol-
diers should go away than come up.
whether as guards or executioners, they
had nothing Lest to do.

2. adseveratione, ‘serious ness,’ whe-
ther assumed (as here and 4.19,3; 6. 2,
2) or real (as 3. 33 , 33 4. 42, 2). Some-
times used of a solemn assertion, as 4. 15,
33 5², 7·

general rule at this time, the property of
those who anticipated condemnation by
suicide was not confiscated (6. 29, 2); but
their accusers were entitled to a share (4.
30, 3), amounting as a legal minimum to
one-fourth, but capable of increase by
decree (4. 20, 2). If therefore, as seems
here to be implied, the whole was divided
among thern, the law was certainly
strained.

praeturae extra ordinem. One prae-
torship was vacant, if that of Libo be-
longs to this year (c. 28, 3); and the
accusers of senatorial rank appear to be
four (c. 30, 1), of whom Vibius (see on 4.
29, 4) seems not to have shared this privi-
lege. Tbe regular number of praetors (1.
14, 6) is stated to have been exceeded, in
at least the later years of Tiberius (Dio,
58. 2ο, 5); so that these may have been
added as supemumeraries to those already
designated for next year. Nipp. thinks
they were allowed to anticipate, each by
a similar period, their proper time of
becoming candidates3 but this would

6. Cotta Messalinus. This person,
who has an evil name in Tacitus (4. 20,
6;5.13„ 4; 6. 5, 1), is the‘ magnae Mes-
salael ippa propago 'of Pers. 2, 72; and
is noted as a gourmand by Plin. (Ν. H.
10. 22, 27, 5²)· Ovid, on the other hand,
who often addresses him in the Epis-tles
‘ex Ponto,’ gives him a very different
character, and his princely munificence to
his dependents' is celebrated: see Introd.
vii. p. 86. His original full name appears
to have been (whether from his mother’ s
side or from adoption) ίΜ. Aurelius
Cotta Maximus‚’ and the cognomen ‘ Mes-
salinus' to have been inherited later from
his brgther (Vell. 2. 112, 2), on whom
see 1. , 5.

7. ne imago. etc. Thus those of
Brutus and Cassius were not borne (3.

76, 5). Other such forms of‘ damnatio ’

memoriae’ are the prohibition of the ,

praenomen (cp.3. 17, 8) or ‘'cognomen
(as here) of the condemned to his pos-
terity3 or the erasion of his name from
the Fasti (3 17, 8).

8. Cn. Lentulus: see on 1. 27,

Ritt. thinks that the change of expressioln s ξ

below to ‘constituti’ and ‘decrevere,’ as
well as the silence of Dio (57. 15, 5),
imply that the proposals os Cotta and ’τ
Lentulus were not carried.

9. supplicationum. According to
Dio (1. l.) this was held by Tiberius
οὐχ ἑαυτοῦ μόνον ἕνεκα ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῦ Αὐ-
Ὑ9ύστον τοῦ τε πατρὸς αὐτοῦ τοῦ Ἰουλίου.

Pomponii Flacci. He was now cos.
design. (c. 41, 2), asterwards legate of
Moesia (c. 66, 3), and subsequently of
Sy ria, where he died (6 27, 3). On his ι
alyleged drinking bout with Tiberim, see 2
Introd. iv. p. 2'4. His brother Pomponius »

Graecinus, a friend of Ovid (ex P. 4. 9), '⁵'
was 005. suff. this year (Inscr. 6442, and ι .‘

Henzen there).
