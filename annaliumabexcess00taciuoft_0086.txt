68 INTRODIJCTION.

the office of ‘pontifex maximus ¹,’ always henceforth held by the princeps

² untila Christian emperor conferred it on the bishop of Rome ²3 and the

¹³ formal acceptance‚ on universal acclamation‚ of the title ‘Pater Patriae’
in 752, 13.c. 2 ⁸.

The following inscription gives his titles nearly at the close of his life :
‘ Imp. Caesar, Divi F. Augustus Pontis. Maxim. Cos. xiii. Imp. xx.
Tribunic. Potestat. xxxvii. P.P.⁴ '

The first succession to the principate must have been modified by the
fact that the successor was already possessed of ‘ proconsulare imperium‚'
and had the tribunitian power ⁵, and afterwards numbered his years of this
office without recognising any change at the death of Augustus. He also
dropped the fiction of periodical renewal of imperium, though a decen-
nial festival was held θ. He must have at least received by decree the
title of ‘ Augustus,' which, though he affected some reserve in its use ⁷,
appears on all his coins and inscriptions; but he never allowed himself
to be called ‘ pater patriae ⁸.' It is also noteworthy that neither Tiberius,

Gaius, nor Claudius, uses the ‘ praenomen imperatoris ⁹.’ The titles borne
by Tiberius at the close of his lise are seen from an inscription quoted
elsewhere ¹⁰.

Gaius appears, from the account of Dio, to have been the firstto receive
all the powers of the principate „by a single decree ¹¹ ; while Claudius was
the first to take the name of‘ Caesarf to which he had no family claim,
as a name of the princeps and his house.

It has been seen that the term‘ princeps' in 1tself1mp11ed no monarchy,
or even magistracy; but in fact stood for a combination of magisteria}
powers, so as to be contrasted as a kind of greater magistracy with the
office of consul, praetor, or aedile ’2. The boast of Augustus, that his emi·
nence in rank gave him no more power than his colleagues m any office ¹³,
can only apply, even in the letter, to such a case as that of his consul-
ships, and has no meaning in relation to the most essential powers of
the principate, the ‘ proconsulare imperium ' and ‘tribunitia potestas,' in
’which he had, as a rule, no colleague. Nor were these powers confined
to their original limits, but received great successive extensions by steps
