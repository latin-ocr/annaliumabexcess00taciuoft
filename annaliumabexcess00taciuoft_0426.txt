50. Contra Μ’. Lepidus in hunc modum exorsus est:

‘sil

torius Priscus mentem suam et aures hominurn polluerit, neque
carcer neque laqueus, ne serviles quidem cruciatus in eum suffe-

1. pecunia donatum. These ‘hono-
raria' from the Caesars to men of letters
seem to have been common. New-fledged
poets are bidden to weep for the death
of Claudius (Seu. Lud. 12, v. 56); and
such liberality was the sole hope of strug-
gling literature in Juvenal's time (7, 1—2 1).

2. corripuit: cp. 2. 28, 4.

composuisse, sc. ‘ eum,' ‘that he had
written another, which ’ etc.

3. maiore praemio vulgaretur,
⁸ might be published and more liberally
rewarded.’ The charge would imply thayt
he had speculated on the death of Drusus,
which would lead to an inference that he
had desired it; as in the case of those
who consulted astrologers ‘ in domum
Caesaris ’ (c. 22, 2, etc).

4. P. Petronii, mentioned again in 6.
45, 4, father of P. Petronius. Turpilianus,
distinguished under Nero (14. 29, 1, etc.,)
and of the first wife of Vitellius (H. 2.
64,1). Inscriptions (see Nipp.) show
him to have been augur, cos. suff. in 772,
A. D. 19, and proconsul of Asia for the
unusual period of six years (Introd. vii.
p. 96), · after which he was legatus of
Syria under Gaius (Jos. Ant. 18. 8, 2,
etc. ); in which capacity heis praised by
Philo (Leg. ad Gai. 1022, folL). He was
also a friend of Claudius, during whose
rule he died (Sen. Lud. 14).

Vitellia. N 1pp thinks her to have
been great· -aunt of the emperor Vitellius.

5. iecerat. ‘ Vaniloquentia,’ found once
in Plaut. and once in Liv., is elsewhere
used by Tacitus only in 6. 31, 2; from
which passage ‘iecerat' has been here
adopted by Ritt„ Halm, and Nipp. for
Clutorius is more

likely to have talked of such a poem than
actually to have recited it, and would
have more strictly shown‘ vaniloquentia'
in doing so; nor is it easy to see how
Vitellia could have pretented not to have
heard what had been formally recited in
her presence; though a simiylar plea isv
advanced in respect of a poem read at a
large banquet (14. 48, 4). Such an ex-
pression as ‘iacere carmen’ may be com-
pared to‘ veteres. .terminos. ,iacie-
bat’ (6. 31, 2), and the verb may in both
places have a force approaching that of
‘iactare’ (as in c. 66, 2). He may have
mentioned his poem, boasted of it, and
quoted bits of it.

6. ad dicendum. .
2. 62, 3.

7. arguentibus ad. perniciem, ‘evi-
dence supporting the charge to his de-
struction.’

8. Haterii Agrippae: see on 1. 77, 3.
On the vote of the cos. design„ seec. 22, 6.

9. ultimum. so ‘summum suppli-
cium ’.(6 3, 5), ‘ultima poena' (Liv.3 -
58). This was beyond the proper sen-
tence, even for‘ maiestas' (see c. 50, 6).

10. M'. Lepidus. see one. 32, 2. This
speech illustrates the discretion(‘ tempe· ,
ramentum ’) ascribed to him in 4. 20, 4.

11. nefaria. The poem must have been
complimentary; but any language treat-
ing Drusus as already dead would be
ominous, and thereforey shocking.

13. career . . .1aqueus. These are ,
parts of the same punishment; the prison ζ
being the ‘Tullianum' or ‘well house’ ἰ
(see gBura, p. 81), in which criminals were ξ
strangled (cp. 4. 29, 23 5. 9, 23 6. 40,1,
11. 2, 5; and the description in Sall. .

. exterritis: cp. ³.
