1. a contactu, ‘from cqutaginn :‘ so and its strangeness is here sostened by com-

used properly in 4. 49, 4, and figuratively
often in Tacitus, as 6. 7, 4, etc.

dividite = ‘ secernite : ' ep. ‘ pro-
vinciae quae mari dividuntur‘ (2. 43, 2);
‘ dividere defensionem ' (3. 15, 3). Earlier
prose writers appear always to add the
prep. and abl. of separation.

6. reditum Agrippinae excusavit.
Elsewhere, the accusative with this verb
either denotes that which has been done,
and is apologised f0r; or (asin 3. 11, 2,

etc.) that which is pleaded in excuse.

Here it means ‘excusavit Agrippinam,
quod non rediret.’

inminentem. This belongs pro-
perly to ¹partum,' but may extend its
force somewhat to ‘hiemem.’ An altar
at Ambitarvium‚ a Treveran village near
Coblenz‚ inscribed ‘ ob Agrippinae puer-
perium‚’ is recorded to have been seen by
Pl. mai. (Suet. Cal. 8). Mommsen shows
(Hermes, 13. pp. 256, foll.) that neither
of the children born in Germany (In-
trod. ix. note 14 ; 15) can have been born
in this year; and that we must sup-
pose at this time the probable premature
birth of a child which never lived, and
which has no place in the list given by
Suetonius.

9. legatum legionis. On these offi-
cers, see Introd. vii. p. 105. Caecina, the
‘legatus Augusti propraetore,’ who had
led these legions to winter quarters, ap-
pears now to have gone to the other camp
at Vetera: see c. 48, 1.

poenas . . . exercuit. This appears
to be taken from Vergil (Aen. 6, 543);

bination with the regular phrase ‘iudicium
exercere.'

10. pro contione. This construction
is familiar in the phrase ‘laudare aliquem
pro contione’ (2. 22, 13 Sall.; Liv„ eto),

where it is generally explained to mean

‘ before the assembly.’ But here the
legions are the assembly. Also, there
‹aiis-5335? ἒξ «ἰίἓῖἳηέἷὲἀῖἓξ {attii
called ‘ contio? Even thus, if ‘ pro con·
tione ’ were equivalent to ‘pro tribunali ¹
or ‘ pro rostris‚’ and analogous in Tacitus
to ‘ pro ripa,’ ‘pro munimentis‚' ‘ pro
muris‘ (2. 9, 33 13, 43 81, ὓς it would
describe the position of the speaker
standing forth on the platforrn‚ rather
than the audience facing it. Unlesq
therefore we may take the phrase tes-:s
mean no more than that they ‘stood Ι,
forth assembled,’ we must explain it (with
Nipp.) to signify ‘ after the fashion of an Ἀ..
assembly;’ the expression being probably
chosen to imply that it was not strictly
a ‘ contio ⁹ convened by the general, but
one sels-constituted. No such use of the
phrase has been however found elsewhere.
A rude trial of this kind, in which sol-
diers were allowed to butcher those whom .
they pronounced guilty, is called ‘ priscus
mos ’ in Ammian. 2. 9, 5.

1 1. suggestu. This is the regular term

for the ‘tribunalf or latsorm in camps,
as H. 1. 36ῬΤἺἛἙΤᾟῐὲθπῆῷιη-αθ
The construction of such with piled up
turs is described in e. 18, 4, but it might

osten be a more permanent structure.
