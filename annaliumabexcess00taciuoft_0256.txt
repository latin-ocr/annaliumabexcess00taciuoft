238 CORNELII TACJT'J ANNALJUM [A. nc. ⁷⁶³·

circum milites, incertus signorum ordo, utque tali in tempore sibi.
quisque properus et lentae adversum imperia aures, inrumpere
Germanos iubet, clamitans ‘en Varus eodemque iterum fato
vinctae legiones! ’ simul haec et cum delectis scindit agmen5

pected ‘in caeno,’ etc, but such an
abl. may be regarded as quasi-instru-
mental. It seems necessary to suppose
the ‘fossae' to be natural holes or fis·
sures; a meaning somewhat supported
by Bell. Afr. 50, 4 (where the word
means a ravine), but hardly so by the
rustic proverb ‘cantherium in fossam'
(Liv. 23. 47. 6), which Nipp. also cites.

1. utque. We have here, as Nipp.
points out, two concurrent constructions
with ‘ut.’ The ‘ ut ’ before ⁴ haesere‚' in
the sense of ‘when,’ extends its force to
‘ aures;‘ and the parenthetical ‘ut tali
in tempore’ (= ‘ ut fieri solet tali in tem-
pore;' cp. 2. 82, 13 H. 3. 71, 4'3 G. 2‚4;
22, 13 Agr. 11, 1) is interposed. The
expression ‘tali in tempore’ (2. 84, 3;
16. 26, 8) may be a reminiscence of Lucr.

1’s9i4kii properus. Cp. ‘sibi . . . tendentes’

H. 1. 13, 3.

3. eodemque. The MS. has ‘et
eodemque.’ In two similar errors in the
second Medicean MS„ ‘ argenti et aurique’
(H. 4. 53, 4), ‘Gallias et Germaniasque’
(H. 4. 54, 1), an accidental transposition
appears not improbable, and the ‘que‘
may well have belonged originally to
‘argenti’ and to ‘Gallias' Here pos-
sibly some word after ‘ et' has been lost :
possibly, as Ritter suggests, the copyist
of some earlier MS. overlooked ‘que ’ in
an abbreviation. and added ‘ et.’

4. vinctae. In the MS. a dot is placed
under ‘n’ by a corrector; whence most
older editions read ⁸ vietae,' which would
be a natural exaggeration of the success
described in c. 64, 4. On the other hand,

‘vinctae’ would resemble the language
of Calgacus, ‘vinctos di nobis tradi-
derunt· (Agr. 32, 3); and ‘velut vincti·
is used of troops encumbered by baggage
and sticky ground (H. 1. 79, 3).

simul haee 0¹³3 a poetical expres-
sion (Stat. Theb. 2, 659). The usual
formula ⁸ simul et . . . et’ is modified to
‘simul . . . et' in 4. 25. 25 H. 3. 13, 3;
Sall. Jug. 97, 4.

6. lapsantes: cp. H. 1. 79, 5. In
Vergil (Aen. θ, 551), and apparently not
in prose before Tacitus.

7. ferri adversum. The MS. has
‘ “adventi” sern‘,‘ the double commas
being added by a later hand in different
ink (see Pfitzner, p. 15). The trans-

position taken to be indicated by them is 3
now generally adopted. Otherwise ‘ ad· ⁷

versum ferri' must be supposed to take
an acssusative, like such compounds as
⁶ inrumpere' (c. 48, 4). etc.

8. figi .. . humo: cp.

Agr. 45, 5, etc.
9. suffosso equo: so in 2. 11, 4, and

v. l. in Verg. Aen. 11, 671. Cp. ‘equis
. . . ilia subfodere ' Liv. 42. 59, 3.

11. vesperascente die; also in 16. 34,
13 H. 2. 49, 2.

see Introd. v. § 93.

12. aperta et solida. This again seems
different from either of the solid spots f„
before mentioned, and. to be altogether ‚2⁴⁴
beyond the morass traversed by the
Cp. e. 68, 4 ‘non hic silvas

‘ pontes.’
nec paludes.‘

13. agger, ‘ material for the ineundt’ sss*

⁶ haesere s
caeno fossisque,’ above, ‘figere animo' ἶ
