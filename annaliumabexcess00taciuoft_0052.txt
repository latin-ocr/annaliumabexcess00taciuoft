34 INTRODUCTION.

had been freely introduced by Cicero and Livy. Besides adopting suchs?
from them and others, Tacitus appears to have added analogous forms..
such as curatissimus 1. 13, 7; flagrantissimus 1. 3, 2, etc.; inplacabilius?
1. 13, 53 inprovisior 2. 47, 1 3 instantius 6. 35, 4 ; obaeratior 6. 17, 4 ;

probably vulgatissimus (ἅπ. εῖρ.) 13. 49, 1. ⁴

8. Tacitus omits with unusual frequency pronouns belonging to
the third person, especially in the accus„ sometimes ‚even so as to
involve harshness or obscurity. Among the more notable instances
are those of the omission of se in 1. 35, 53 2. 71, 83 83, 4; 4. 59,
5, etc.; and of eum in 1. 69, 3; 3. 49, 1; 4. 58, 4; 71, 5, etc. Also
an abl„ such as iis, or quibus, is constantly omitted in concise uses of
the abl. abs. (see below, § 31 c). Omissions are found of the genit-
of such pronouns, as in 4. 70, 4 ; or dat„ as in 4. 7, 4. A few in-
stances occur of omissione of pronouns of the first or second pronoun,
as nos 1. 22, 3; me 4. 38, 15 12. 21, 13 nobis 3. 54, 5. See Joh.
Miiller on 1. 27, 23 Pfitzner, p. 1133 Nipp. on 1. 293 5. 10.

9. 'I'he use of quis for quisque in the constant form ut quis,
e. g. 1. 69, 2; 2. 24. 6; 73, 63 83, 1, etc„ appears to be strictly
T acitean (Botticher). Other usages, though rare, are not without earlier
precedent; e. g. quis for uter 1. 47, 23 3. 1, 4 (Livy); quis ille, hic ille
(with brachylogy) 11. 7, 1; 12. 36, 2; 14. 22, 4 (Cic.); quidquid istud
1. 42, 2; eius for suus 4. 67, 1 (Caes. and Cic.) ; suus for eius '45 36,
3, etc. Dr. § 10-20.

10. The accusative of place towards which motion takes place
(Roby 1108), as used of the names of countries or large islands‚ is
generally confined in classical prose to Greek names with the Latinized
ending in ‘-us,' as Aegyptum 2. 59, 1 (Madvig 232, Obs. 4), but is also
used by Tacitus, as by poets, with greater latitude, as Hiberos 12. 51,
4, etc.; analogous to this is campos propinquabant 12. 13, 1; and the
accus. with proximus 15. 15, 6. Such accusatives, though always mtegj

are not unexampled in earlier prose. Dr. § 38. ³1 * ,ἲ ,μοί ἕως. ἓν &¹35³

by Tacitus than by any prose writer except Apuleius, not only in its
