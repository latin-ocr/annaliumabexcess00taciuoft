their means of knowledge. Such is the veneral attitude of Livy
towards his chroniclers; such again appears to be that of Tacitus
towards his ‘auctores’ He could firmly reJ'ect a floating tale which
they had never recognised, and which was otherwise improbable13 he l
could supplement their defects in detail, judge freely between their
differences3 we can imagine him to have rejected, even in the face of ¹
testimony, a statement evidently inconsistent with itself or exaggerated:
s but where a story was generally accepted, and did not bear plain marks
of overstatement or incredibility ², we cannot suppose it to have occurred
to him to ask whether its subject was one on which his authorities
were competent to speak. For instance, the details of a private cor·
respondence between Tiberius and Seianus are given without expressed
or implied suspicion ³, though it appears to us almost impossible to L
imagine authentic evidence of them.
'V Any such misleading effect of a ‘consensus auctorum' would be Ἰ
aggravated, if, as has been seen to b‘e probable in respect to the prin· ..
cipate of Tiberius, the original >authorities belonged almost wholly to ⁴5
the hostile section ⁴. The critic might feel that he had made a con·
siderable deduction sor their ⁴prejudices, and might naturally consider 0
that this was sufficient. -
. It is also noteworthy that he treats the testimony of his authorities ς
3 as evidence not only for an act but for a motive⁵3 and only with diffi- ἔ
dence suggests an explanation as his own ὃ. Her'e it is probable that
the discrepancy of his witnesses left him much rotom for choice, and Α
enabled him, without going beyond the alternatives suggested by them,
to interpret the acts in accordance with his general conception of the γ
character. . .
Further explanation must be found in the personal opinions of -
u) Tacitus, and in the circumstances of his life. .
His political attitude to the early Caesars could not really be one of
{indifference3 for the revolution which they accomplished and con-
solidated was with him the main cause of the degeneracy of his own
age. Lleas he is to the emperors under whom he wrote 3 who had
‘combined monarchy with freedom⁷’ and brought about ‘an age of
