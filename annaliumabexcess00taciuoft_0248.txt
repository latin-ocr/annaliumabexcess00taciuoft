1. egregium, etc. Tacitus seems here
to have in mind the passage of Verg.
Aen. 4. 93, etc.

2. sibi. On this dative, see Introd. v.
5 17: cp. ‘quibus . . . legiones procu-
buerint’ H. 4. 17, 6. On the three
legions, see Introd. vii. p. 103.

3. totidem legatos. Varus was him-
self the ‘legatus Augusti‚’ but he is
separated from the legati in c. 61, 6, and
the context seems to show here that the
‘legati legionum’ are meant. The fate
of a legatus named N umomus Vala' 1s men-

4. palam. His attack‚ though by way
ofstratagem, is viewed as open war, com-
pared to the treason of Segestes.

5. bellum traetare: cp. 6. 44, 3, · H.
4. 73, 4. Aphrase formed on the analogy
of‘ negotium tractare? etc.

7. sacerdotium hominum. The MS.
has‘ sacerdotiu· . hominum' with ‘e’
written over ‘u :’ and it appears to be
considered that the colon is from the same
late hand as the ‘ e,' and inserted to indi-
cate that ‘ hominem ’ is to be taken with
the following words, and referred to
Segestes (see Pfitzner, p. 22). If we
suppose the priesthood to be to Augustus,
or to him and Julius (see c. 57, 2),
‘sacerdotium hominum' may well be a
contemptuous expression, like ‘ inter
numina dicatus’ below, from a German
who recognised no such divinities. For
other conjectures, see Baiter, and Halm,
Comm. Crit. That of‘ hostium' (Nipp'3
from Halm, Ed. 1), and· hoc unum’
(Bezzenberger, retaining the colon of the
MS. ), seem the most felicitous.

supply ‘Segestem’ with ‘excusaturos’

³ seems beside the mark. The sentence

‘quod. ‚viderint’ describes the insig-
nia, not of Roman military invasion, but
rather of Roman rule, as they had seen it
before the defeat of Varus· , and Segestes
could hardly be regarded as the cause of
this. The thought is that the Germans
could never forgive themselves for having
allowed Roman dominion to exist at all
among them, and would now be doubly
culpable to suffer its restoration.

9. alfia gentibus, ete„ i. e. those who
knew it not might think it good for
them; those who have felt it and cast it
off should not now sear enemies less
formidable than those whom they baffled.

‘Ignorantia' isa causal abl.: cp. c. 57, 2.

ιο. nescia. This is passively used ιιι
16.14, 5, and in Plautus: cp. gnarus?
‘ignarus' c. 5, 4, etc.

that the age of Arminius (2. 88, 4) was

very nearly the same as that of Ger-
