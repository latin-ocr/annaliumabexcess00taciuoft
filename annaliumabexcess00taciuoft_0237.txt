Varus would justify such extremities of
warfare in the mind of a Roman It is
more probable that such acts towards

to express special indignation against

‘perfidious peacebreakers' (2.131).

bant. The Germans had no temples (G. 9,

Baduhennae’ in 4. 73, 7. The attributes
of this deity are unknown: the form

‘Tanfanae’(13er0a1d‚etc.) is a nearer
approach to the name as found' 111 3 Ger-
man 11118 of the ninth or tenth century
