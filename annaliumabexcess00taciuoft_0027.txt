GENUJNENESS oF THE ANNALS. 9

¹ senate ¹, is confirmed by a coin of that city, with a representation of
the temple, and having all three names on the superscription ²,

9. The title of pontifex, given to L. Piso, better known as praefectus
urbi ³, is confirmed by the ‘ Acta Arvalium ⁴!

10. The statement, that Theophanes of Mytilene had received divine
honours from his countrymen ⁵, is confirmed by Mytilenaean coins bear-
ing his effigy, with the word θεὸς added to his name ⁶.

A few instances of less direct confirmation may here be added :—

1. A soldier named Rufus Helvius is mentioned as having received
a civic crown ⁷. An inscription bears the name of ‘ M. Helvius Rufus
Civica, prim(us) pil(us)‚’ suggesting the assumption of a cognomen re-
cording the distinction ⁸.

2. C. Silanus is stated to have had a sister, Torquata, ‘ priscae sancti-
moniae virgo ⁹.' Inscriptions mention ‘Iunz‘a, C. Silani s., Torquata:
as a Vestal virgin, and as chief of that body ¹⁰.

3. Julius Indus, one of the Treveri, is mentioned as in command of
a ‘ delecta manus ¹¹,’ subsequently called an ‘ala ¹2! His name appears
to suggest the origin of an ‘ala Indiana' mentioned in several in-
scriptions¹³. '

4. Caninius Gallus is mentioned as one of the quindecimviri, and
as ‘ scientiae caerimoniarumque vetus ¹⁴‚’ a description suitable to a person
who can be shown to have existed at that time, and to have been
⁸ magister fratrum Arvalium ¹⁵.’

Other instances might, no doubt, be added, but the above will prob-
ably be considered sufficient.

Another curious apparent confirmation will tend, if admitted, to
carry back the date of these books nearly to that of their reputed
author. In the account of the Frisian rebellion occurs the sentence
‘ad sua tutanda digressis rebellibus ¹⁶? Ptolemy‚ writing in the gene-
ration next to that of Tacitus, in his list of towns in north Germany
inserts Σιατουτάνδα as the name of a place 17; which certainly looks
as if he had the passage of the Annals before him, and misunder-
stood it.
