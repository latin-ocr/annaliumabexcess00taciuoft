CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 767·

per annos sacramentum in nomen Tiberii3 interrogatusque a
Tiberio num se mandante eam sententiam prompsisset, sponte
dixisse respondit, neque in iis quae ad rem publicam pertinerent
consilio nisi suo usurum, vel cum periculo offensionis: ea solae

species adulandi supererat.

funus divi Iulii turbassent, ita Augustum 'in foro potius quarn in ’1

Messalla Corvinus, and brother of Cotta
Messalinus (2. 32, 2, etc.). He was con-
sul in 751, 13.c. 3 (Suet. Galb. 4); as
was his son in 773, A. D. 2ο (3. 2, 5),
and his grandson in 811, Α. D. 58 (13. 34,
1). He is also known as having won
‘ triumphalia’ in Pannonia (Vell. 2. 112),
as a friend of Tibullus (2. 5, 17), and of
Ovid (ex P. 1. 73 2. 2), as a speaker (3.
34. 2), and writer (Suet. Aug. 7433 but as
of servile character (here, and 3. 18, 3).
Some further references to him are given
by Nipp.

renovandum, etc. This annual re-
newal of the ‘ sacramentum ' had become
a regular custom on the first of January
by 822, A. D. 69 (H. 1. 55, 1). We also
hear of such renewals on the anniversary
of accession (Pl. ad Trai. 52). See
Momms. Staatsr. ii. p. 768.

4. offensionis. Dr. notices that this
form is used invariably in the Annals, as
‘ offensa ’ invariably in the other works.

ea. sola species, etc., i. e. this show
of independence was the only form of
flattery not stale.

according to Suet. (Aug. 100) ; which
honour had been previously paid to Sulla
(App. B. C. 1. 106). and was here the
natural climax to the previous bearing b

‘decuriones' and by knights. See on e. 7, .

funeral are Suet. Jul. 14 3 Plut. Caes. 685

the ‘Mausoleum’ built by Augustus in

take it to mean ‘ when slavery was not yet
incorporated into their s'ystem,’ the meta-
phor being that of an undigested meal
(cp. Juv. 1, 1433 ‘cruda studia’ Petron.

to be that of an unhealed wound.
