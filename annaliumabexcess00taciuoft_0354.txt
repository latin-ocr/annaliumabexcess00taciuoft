1. ob propinquitatem etiarn etc. This
is thrown in as an additional circumstance
suggesting the comparison. With ‘ inter-
iit,’ ‘ uterque ' must be supplied from the
sense. That, to a Roman, Antioch and
Babylon should seem near each other, is
probable enough to make it needless to
take ‘ propinquitaS,’ with Pfitzner (p. 93),
to mean the resemblance of the places of
death to each other, in respect of being
both ‘externas inter gentes.' Tacitus
would surely have expressed this by a.
less misleading word.

2. fatie. Here used of the circumstances
or ¹ sors vitae’ in general.

adaequarent, ‘compared’ The verb
appears to be nowhere else used exactly
in this sense; but we have ‘aequare et
conferre scelera’ (Cic. Verr. ii. 1. 8, 21),
and other similar instances.

3. genere insigni. Nipp. brackets
these words as a marginal note of some
one who overlooked ‘mortis’ following
‘genus’ above. Certainly the words are
in themselves a weak expression for per-
sons so exalted, and destroy the symmetry
of the passage, the rest of which answers
to ‘ sormam, aetatem, genus mortis: above.
Pfitzner (p. 92) would apparently make
these words explanatory of ‘ corpore de-
coro,’ as suggesting that each had his
own remarkable type of beauty; but this
again would make Tacitus use a most
misleading expression.

triginta. Germanicus died in— his
thirty-fourth year (Suet. Cal. 1), Alex-
ander in his thirty-third.

4. suorum insidiis. ⁸ Suorum’ might
be understood of professed friends, as
Piso, or the speakers may be supposed
to assume the guilt of Tiberius and Au-
gusta. The story that Alexander died of
poison concocted by Aristotle, sent by

Antipater, and administered by his son,

sed hunc, etc. It is assumed as
notorious that Alexander was the oppo-
site to him in all these points. The com-
parison of characters is suggested by the
resemblance of circumstances above men-
tioned.

5. voluptatum. ‘Modicus’ takes such
a genit. (cp. Introd. v. ξ 33 e γ) in 3. 72,
33 4. 52, 2, etc.; among earlier authors,
apparently only in Vell. 1. 12, 3.

certis, ‘legitimate’

6. proeliatorem. This word is very
rare, but found in Dial. 37, 7; val. Max.
3. 2, 24, and later.

etiam si temeritas afiierit, ‘though
without rashness:’ an invidious word,
used to depreciate the daring οἱ Alexaq-
der, whose military genius Romans are
not magnanimous enough to acknowledge
freely. See the brilliant, but partial cri—
ticism of Livy (9.'17—19), who however
owns that the enterprise of Alexander in-
volved no rashness: ‘nihil aliud quam
bene ausus vana contemnere (c. 17, 16).

7. praepeditus. Used of a tethered
horse, 4. 25, 2: ep. also 3. 3, 23 15. 66,
