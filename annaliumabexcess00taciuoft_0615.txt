though the Aventine quarter was again
partially destroyed.

(1. 1.) that he completed buildings begun
by Augustus, and restored many older

 

1. domuum et insulan-um, ‘ manaim-15
, and blocks of houses ’ (cp. 15. 41, 1 ; 43,
3)·ῗῖΐεῖἲὸἷῖῐιῖιῗῖὶτε the palaces os. the rich,

' the latter the masses os building let out

in separate tenements to the poor (Introd.
vii.. 88).

2.p miliens sestertium, the same sum
as that of the loan (c. 17, 4). This act
os munificence is ignored by Suetonius:
see note on 4. 64, 2.

in munificentia. ea: so Halm and
Nipp. after Otto. ‘ Ea’ is absent from
the· text os the MS„ but a marginal ad-
dition in an old hand, and may easily
have dropped out aster ‘ munificentia.’
Others insert it before or after ‘ in.’

conlocatum, ‘wgs‘hffituwedss strictly
used of investments in land, houses, etc.
(cp. c. 17, 2); but Cic. so says (Phil. 3.
2, 4) ‘patrimonium . . . in reipublicae sa-
lute conlocavit’ (correcting himself for
‘ effudit ’).

3. quantomodious,etc. Nipp.'points
out that ‘ quanto ' is to be taken only with
⁶ modicus. The bounty was so much the

more popular, as Tiberius was moderate

⁸ building for himself, nor had erected
ore than two public buildings.

4. duo. Dio (57. 10, 2) speaks cor-
rectly of the former of these as his only
new erectio‘m omitting mention of the
theatre, as having been only restored (see
3.72‚ 4). Velleius (2. 130, 1) and Suetonius
(Tib. 47) mention both works. Dio adds

ones, but never inscribed his name on
them. This temple to Augustus appears
to have stood on the side of the Palatine
facing the Capitol (see on 1. 10, 8).

5. perfecta . . . haud dedicavit.. Suet.
(Tib. 47 ; Cal. 21) says that he left both
unfinished: but, as regards the temple,
Tacitus is confirmed by a coin belonging
to the year 787, A.D. 34, in which it is
represented; which would seem to show
that it was completed in that year (Cohen,
i. p. 195, 68). The dedication by Gaius,
described by Dio (59. 7, 1) under 790,
Α. D. 37, is also commemorated by a
medai (see engraving, Cohen, p. 2 38, 8).

7. quattuor progeneri: see c. 15, ις
²7, 1; 4· 75, 1-

9. P. Petronius: see 3. 49, 2.

12. Gn. Acerronius C. Pontius. A
Lusitanian inscription (Orelli 3665) gives
their full names as Cn. Acerronius Procu-
lus, C. Petronius Pontius Nigrinus. N ipp.
notes that the former received a statue at
Athens as proconsul of Achaia (C. Ι. Att.
iii. 1, 611); and that the latter, an a-
dopted son of C. Petronius Umbrinus (cos.
suff. with M. Asinius in 778, A.D. 25), is
thought by Borghesi to have been father
of Pontia. the insamous poisoner of her
sons (Juv. 6, 637), who is called by the
old Scholiast daughter of P. Petronius. ’

15. rettuli, c. 20, ι. Her speedy death
is also mentioned by Philo (Leg. ad Gai.
9). Suet. (Cal. 12) says that she died in
