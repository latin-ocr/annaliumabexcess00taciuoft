TACJTUS’ USE OF HIS MATERJALS. αι

tion of the guiltless 3 ' forming in his mind so painful a contrast to the
roll of foreign conquests and great domestic struggles which his prede-
cessors were privileged to unfold ¹. Much indeed that would have b'een
far more interesting to ourselves has thus been sacrificed, but heis at
least entitled to the credit of having adhered steadily to his plan ². ,
The apparent inconsistency in the profession of a didactic purpose by
an author who inclines to fatalism‚ is to be met by showing that the
opinions of Tacitus on this subject are neither so prominent nor so
definite as to make such inconsistency palpable, and that the saving
clauses in his creed evidently sufficed to prevent his being himself

ι perplexed by it.

The principal passage on the subject does not directly treat of the
freedom of human action, but raises the question whether prosperity and
adversity and the chief occurrences of life are due to chance or fate ³.
The latter would imply the agency of the gods, who are elsewhere recog-
nised as originators of destiny ⁴, and rulers of man and nature ⁵, sometimes
as caring at least to punish ⁶, if not to protect ⁷, sometimes as those

’ who would bless us if our sins permitted them ⁸, sometimes as pursuing

their purpose with sublime indifferenceaeto our good deeds or evil⁹.

'Phe Epicurean doctrine, that the deity cares for none of us, that good
or bad are fortunate or unfortunate as blind chance may guide, is briefly
dismissed iri this passage. In an atheistic form it was no doubt unaccept-
able to Tacitus and to general opinion, though popular enough, as Pliny

has shown ¹⁰, when brought into apparent harmony with religion by the

clastic theology which worshipped Fortune as a goddess ¹¹ and reconciled

⁴ opposites by the apotheosis of a negation.

The Stoic theory, as stated in the same place, besides repeating the

- well-known doctrine, that the good are never really miserable nor the

wicked happy, reconciles destiny and sreewill by supposing that after man

Ἐ has made his ‘choice of life‚' its consequences are determined, not by

³ Many such omissions as those noted

³ by Mr. G. A Simcox (Hist. of Latin Litera-

5 ture, ii. p. 175) seem due to the limit
ῑ which Tacitus thus' imposes on himself.

¹⁰ SeeN H. 2. 7(5)‚ 22. where he looks
on such a goddess as a. mere invention
(cp. Juv 10. 366), but as the only deity
popularly worshipped. He adds that the
alternative of astrological fatalism sup-
poses the deity to have ordained once for
all, and then tyo rest for ever.

mixture of sceptical and theological ideas
in the first of these passages is note-
worthy.
