Tacitus may have followed Pliny, who
says (N. H. 2. 84, 86, 200) ‘ maximus
terrae memoria mortalium exstitit motus,
Tiberii Caesaris principatu, duodecim
urbibus Asiae una nocte prostratis. ’ In
HMiigeron. Chron. (Opera, vol. viii. p.566,
M1gne) )thirteen names are given, Ephesus

{a well -known pedestal preserved at

erected to Tiberius at Rome by the ciues,
and dating from 783, A. D. 3ο, has the
