83. Honores, ut quis amore in Germanicum aut ingenio vali-

2 dus, reperti decretique: ut nomen eius Saliari-carmine caneretur3

sedes curules sacerdotum Augustalium locis superque eas quer-
ceae' coronae statuerentur3 ludos circenses eburna effigies prae-
iret, neve quis flamen aut augur in locum Germanici nisi gentis 5

Iuliae crearetur.

arcus additi Romae et apud ripam Rheni et

in monte Suriae Amano, cum inscriptione rerum gestarum ac
mortem ob rem publicam obisse, sffulchrum Antiochiae, ubi

two months after the death (see note on
c. 72, 2), and probably some time after
the news had reached Rome. ·

1. Honores ῃι reperti. Mutilated
fragments are preserved, both of the
decree relating to Germanicus (C. I. L.
vi. 1, 9113 Henzen 5382), and of that
relating to Drusus (C. I. L. vi. 1, 912;
Henzen 5381); which, as having been
mainly in similar terms (cp. 4. 9, 2), will
hiisonge plllatzes gigpeffffiditional confirm-
a on o w a is s ere.

2. Saliari carmine. For this famous
hymn, see C. 1. L. vi. 1, 21043 Orelli

054 ; Wilmanns 2879; Marquardt,
taatsv. iii. p. 419, etc. The old portion,

unintelligible to Horace (Epp. 2. 1, 86),

¹ and, according to Quintilian (1. 6, 40),

even to the priests themselves, is to be
distinguished from the ‘carmina in uni-
versos semones composita‚' in which
modern names could be inserted. The

name of Augustus had been inserted in·

his lifetime (Mon. Anc. ii. 21), apparently
as early as 725, Β. c. ²9 (Dio, 51. 20, 1):
but whether the precedent was followed
in the mse of succeeding principes, is un-

j known. In the decree respecting Ger-

manicus [‘ canit]ur in Palatio ’ is thought
to be traeeable, and a less successful
attempt has been made to trace words to

¹ a similar effect in that of Drusus (see

” Marquardt, p. 420, note 7). The only

other name recorded as inserted is that of
Χῃεὶιις, 80ιῖ of Marcus Aurelius (Vita M.
21, 5 .

3. sedes curules. The curule chair
crowned was placed in the theatre at
feasts. Such an honour was paid to
Julius Caesar in his lifetime (Dio, 44. 6,
3), ἐξ ἴσον τοῖς τῶν θεῶν, and to Marcellus
ut his death (Dio, 53. 30, 6). A place is
here assigned among those reserved for
the ‘ Augustales: because Germanicus had
been one of them (1. 54, 2). Words
apparently referring to a similar honour
are found in the decree to Drusus. The

⁴ erown described is in form the eivic

*fe-x>

crown, but made of precious materials
(διάλιθον καὶ διάχρυσον Dio, 44. 6, 3);
such as that which had been decreed to
Augustus, as saviour of the citizens in
general, in 727, B. C. 27 (Dio, 53. 16, 4),
and which formed a permanent decoration
of the palace ‘qua postes augustae domus

sempiterna gloria triumphant ’ (val. Max.
2. 8, 7).

· 4. ludos . .“ . effigies praeiret. The
words ‘imagines ponerentur ’ are found in
the inscription, and ‘Circienses ' in that of
Drusus. Dion. Hal. (7. 72) describes at
these games processions of images of the
gods, borne by men on their shoulders.
An ivory figure of Julius Caesar was so
borne in a ‘tensa ' in his lifetime (Suet.
Jul. 763 Dio, 43. 45, ’ 2); and such a
posthumous honour was decreed to several
of the imperial family (see Marquardt, iii.
p. 489). ‘Praeeo’ takes such an accus.
in 6. 21, 2; 15. 4, 1; otherwise only in
such a phrase as ¹ praeire verba? etc.

5. flamen,sc. ‘Augustalis' His tenure
of this priesthood (on which see Mar-

quardt, iii. p. 453), and his augurship are

ν recorded in many inscriptions (e. g. Orell.

660, 3064): and the former is distinct
from his membership in the ‘ sodales
Augustalis ' (see on 1. 54, 2). Drusus ,is
also recorded as augur and flamen Augus-
talis (Orell. Insc. 211, ete.): and there-
fore probably succeeded Germanicus in⁶
accordance with this decree.

6. arcus. The inscription has the words
‘alter Ianus fieret,’ and ‘tertius Ianus?
After the latter, thewords ‘ Geeranis' and
[‘ tumu]lum Drusi ' are traeeable, appar-
ently referring to the arch near the Rhine.

7. monte Amano. This term is used
by Strabo (12. 2, 2, 535) to include all
the mountains encircling the gulf of Issus,
and the passes from Syria to Cilicia, on
one of which the arch probably stood.

8. mortem . . . obisse: cp. 3. 6, 1.
Similar words were used of the elder
Drusus (‘ cui suit heu mortis publica
causa’), Epic. Drusi, 458.
