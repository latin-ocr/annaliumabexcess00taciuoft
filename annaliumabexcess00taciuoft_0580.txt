parenthetical and abbreviated insertion of
this clause, instead os a full expression of
it in its proper place. Nipp. compares the

in theatro. Such gatherings were
now the chief occasions on which popular
demands or other grievances sound ex-
pression. Sidonius Apollinaris in the
fifth century writes (Ep. 1. 10) ⁴ vereor,
ne samem populi Romani theatralis fra-
gor insonet et infortunio meo publica
deputetur esuries! On the occasion of
another such dearth, Claudius was mob-
bed in the sorum (12. 43, 2).

3. quanto maiorem, etc. Augustus
is said (Aur. Vict. Epit. 1, 6) to have im-
ported twenty million ‘modii' annually
from Egypt alone. Tiberius reckons the
corn supply as his special sanction (3. 54,

‘in‚' see note on 1, 14, 3.

8. Geminius, Celsus, Pompeius.
Here, as in 2. 48, 1, the mention of Ro-

man knights by one name has led some
to think that praenomina have dropped

out. These persons are unknown, sor the
Ῥοῦφος Γεμίνιος of Dio, 58. 4, 5, is now
taken to be Fufius Geminus.

11. Iulius celsus tribunus: see c. 9,
6. His full name is given to distinguish
him from the Celsus just above ς and the
recent specification of his tribunate (l. 1.)
enables it to be here left undescribed.

The chain probably connected the mana-
cles on his wrists: and may be supposed
to have been usually locked in some way
together, but accidentally left free to its
full length.
