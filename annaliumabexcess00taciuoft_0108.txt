class are found a generation later ¹. Even at this date there are those whose
wealth and position might vie with that of the nobles ², and great numbers
must have belonged to professions' or callings requiring high education
and earning high payment. The remainder probably swelled the ranks

of the client-class. Augustus endeavoured both to limit manumission by
enactment and precept ⁸, and also to utilise freedmen in the service of the ¹
state ς in which they formed the bulk of the 1vigiles ⁴‚' and were even ’

drafted wholesale into the legions after the catastrophe of Varus ⁵; while
un'der Tiberius a large number were deported to be made useful or left
to perish in Sardinia ⁶, and a law was passed to define the status of a
class os this order ⁷.

Any numerical estimate of the ‘plebs urbana' with their wives and
families rests almost wholly on guess-work. We cannot tell how many
of the suburban or even nearest rural population may have helped to
swell the numbers of the 200‚000 recipients of public corn under Augustus⁸,
or the 250,000 to 300‚000 sharers in his occasional ‘ congiaria ⁹! Itis

therefore not surprising that calculations from such data give a result·

varying from more than a million to less than half that sum ¹⁰.

Similar uncertainty attends the attempt to estimate the mass of public γ

and private urban slaves. They are generally called a vast multitude ¹¹ ;'

the ‘ familia ' of Pedanius Secundus alone numbers 400 ης still the
majority of the plebs must have had none or next to none, and many poor
knights or senators very few. A reasonable estimate takes them a't
800‚000 or 900,000, who, with perhaps 60,000 peregrini, and a garrison
of 20,000 ¹⁸, may make up the million and a half to two millions of soulgs
in Rome ²⁴. '

To this vast crowd the chief gift of Augustus was a fairly efficient
organigaQQolice. The city was partitioned into fourteen ‘ regiones}
each allotted to the charge of one of the magistrates for the year ¹⁶.
