1. haee apud senatum, sc. ‘acta'
On the omission of such verbs, see In-
trod. v. ᾗ 38 b. The expression here
includes all the cases mentioned from
c. 2.

apud prinoipem. On the personal
jurisdiction of the ‘princeps,’ see Introd.
vi. p. 74; Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p. 920,
foll. Some further traces of such trials
before Tiberius can be gathered from
Suet. Tib. 62, but it is his usual practice
to devolve the responsibility of condem—
nation on the senate: see 3. 10, 63 and
below, c. 47, 4.

3. individui, ‘inseparable from him?
The word appears to be almost ἆπ. εἶρ.
in this sense: in Cicero it means ‘in-
divisible.’

4. insidiarum . . . internuntius: see
2. 28, 1; whence ‘Flaccus' is restored
above for the MS. error ‘ Atticus.'

5. Curtium Atticum: see 4. 58, 1.
His overthrow must have been men-
tioned in the lost part. Marinus is other-
wise unknown.

6. sua exempla: so ‘ sua quisque
exempla debet . . . pati ’ Phaedr. Ι,
26.

consultor-ee, ‘the deviserst’ so ‘prava
incepta consultoribus noxae esse’ Sall. H.
1. 48, 1 D, 51 K, p. 144 G. The use in 4.
24, 3 is also from Sall.

7. 1... Piso pontifex. This title, con·
firmed by the ‘Acta Arvalium‘ of 767,
A.D. 14 (C. Ι. L. vi. 1, 2023 a) dis-
tinguishes this L. Piso from others of the
same name (cp. 2. 34, 1; 4. 45, 1 ; 62, 1).
He was consul in 739, B. C. 15, and prob-
ably father of the ‘ iuvenes’ addressed by
Horace: see on 4. 45, 15 62, 13 Por-

phyr. on Hor. A. P. On the story re-
specting his appointment to the ‘prae-
fectura urbis,’ see Introd. iv. p. 24.

rarum, etc. On such parentheses,
see Introd. v. ξ 82.

8. fato: cp. 2. 71, 2, etc.

nullius servilis sententiae, etc. It
is doubtful whether he is the person
spoken ofin 2. 32, 43 3. 68, 1.

10. memoravi. This mention is lost.
The father is otherwise known as L.
Calpurnius C. f. L. n. Piso Caesoninus,
cos. 696, Β. c. 58, and censor 704, Β. c. 50,
the supportet of Clodius and enemy of
Cicero, who attacks him in two speeches
(de Prov. Cons.‚ and in Pis.). He was
also father of Calpurnia, wife of Julius
Caesar.

11. decus triumphale, i. e. the ‘ tri-
umphalia ornamenta.’ This was in 743,
Rc. 11 (Dio, 54. 34, 6), aster a three
years war (Vell. 2. 98, 1).

12. reeens continuam, ‘ an office re-
cently made permanent3’ ‘recens‚’ adv.
as in 2. 21, 1. It is noted (Dr. Synt. und
Stil, § 22) that this use of ‘recens’ with
adjectives occurs first in the Annals, and
is found only with adjectives having a
participial meaning. Piso is the first from
whom an unbroken series of ‘ praefecti' is
reckoned; but it is doubtful whether his
own tenure of office was continuous: see
notes on c. 11, 7. ’

insolentia parendi, ‘for want of
habits of submission.' The expression
seems strange in reference to the time of
Tiberius, but should be understood in
contrast to the more fully established
authority of the praefect when Tacitus
wrote.
