would imply that she was a fifth daughter,
but she seems to belong to a later genera-
tion than the five daughters of App.
Claudius Caecus. Her statue was placed
in the temple of the Mater Deum to
commemorate the story told of her draw-
ing the ship off a sandbankv when the
goddess was brought to Rome in 550,
Β. C. 204. The ship appears to have been
called ‘ Salvia‚’ and the juxta-position of
the names ‘Matri Deum et Navi Sal-
viae’ (see C. Ι. L. vi. 1, 492—4)‚ which
has been taken by some to imply a dei-
fication of Claudia under the title of
‘N avisalvia‚’ may perhaps suggest an
origin for the story.

1. bis elapsam. The temple inwhvich
it stood, dedicated in 563, B.'C. 191 <Liv.
36. 36, 3), on the Palatine, had been
bumed in 643 and 756, 13.c. 111, A.D. 3,
and the flames are said on each occasion
to have stopped short of the statue (vVal.
Max. 1. 8, 11). The sentence -would more
naturally have run ‘ statuam apud aedem
. . . consecratam, vim ignium bis elap-
sam.’ Borghesi (2, 183) notes that the
statue is represented upon coins.

3. caerimoniam: cp. 3. 61, 3. The
sanctity of the ‘Caelius mons ' would be
inereased by calling it ‘Augustus’

5. Haud fuerit absurdum. A similar
antiquarian note is introduced, with almost
the same words of apology, in 12. 24, 1.

6. cognomento=‘n0mine:’ see note
on 1. 23, 6; 2. 6, 5, ete.; so also ‘vo-
cabulo' below (cp. 1. 23, 4). No other
menltion appears of this old name os the
Cae ian.

frequens, nowhere else with genitive,
but here accommodated to the construe-
tion of ‘ fecundus’ (Dr'ager).

7. appellitatum. This verb is found
here only in Tacitus, who seems to take
it from the speech of Claudius (col. ’
7ἱ. 22), which his version of the story
follows.

Caele Vibenna, Varro (L. L. 5, 46)
and Dion. Hal. (2. 36) represent this per- ,⁴
son (with some differences of orthography) ι
as an ally of Romulus against Tatius. 2
In the speech of Claudius (col. i. 17, .
sqq. : see Appendix to B. xi.)‚ Servius Tul-
lius or Mastarna is spoken of as migra· r
ting from Etruria and settling on this .
hill, and naming it after Caelius Vivenna,
his old captain in arms. Livy, who 'i
makes no mention of this legend, says s
that the Caelian was assigned by Tullus ,ἰ
Hostilius to the people transported from ς
Alba (1. 30, 1). ,

8. portauisset. The MS. has ‘auxi- 3
lium appellatum tauisset.’ Halm follows
Doed. in reading as above, ‘ appessatum’ j
being supposed to be a mere repetition of ,Ξ
the previous ‘appellitatum,’ and the 21³2}
parent tense ending taken to be that ofG
‘portavisset‚’ from ‘auxilia portabant’·‘}:
(Sall. Cat. 6, 5). For several ‚other pro- J
posed corrections, see Baiter, and Halm, ..I

Dion. Hal. 3, 1), and Ancus Marcius (0¹⁶2ss
Rep. 2. 183 Strab. 5. 3, 7, 234); theseg]
writers also differ as to the circumstanoesss}
