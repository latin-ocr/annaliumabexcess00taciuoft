APPENDIX III.

SUMMARY OF EVENTS DURING THE INTERVAL FOR WHICH
THE HISTORY OF TACITUS IS HERE LOST.

SENTENCE soon followed against Agrippina and N ero. The latter was
declared by the senate a public enemy ¹, and both were hurried into*
banishment, chained and in closed litters, with strict orders to the escort
to allow none whom they met so much as to stand and look back at ’
them ². Nero was sent to Pontia (Poma), Agrippina to Pandateria, the ⁷
old prison-house of Julia 9 ; where she is said to have been treated with
such violence as to have lost an eye by a blow from the centurion, and
to have had food forced into her mouth when she attempted to starve
herself 4. Drusus, who had been used as a tool by Seianus against his fs
brother ⁵, was for the present left unattacked, and probably during this
year received Aemilia Lepida in marriage ⁶. ¹

Asinius Gallus, while on a visit to Tiberius at Capreae, was denounced
by a secret missive, and condemned in absence by the senate, yet not ζ “
put to death or permitted to despatch himself, but sent to Rome andi}
detained there in custody in the house of a magistrate, with just food}
enough forced upon him to support lifess. His friend Vallius Syriacus}
the rhetorician was put to death sor no other cause than his friendship⁹. .ss
Seianus had now prepared his attack on Drusus by the seduction of hiso
wife, and made some representation to Tiberius, who sent the young·
man back from Capreae to Rome ¹⁰, where a more formal charge, pre-,5
ferred through the agency of Cassius Severusss, caused him also to be
pronounced a public enemy ¹2 and imprisoned in a chamber in the
Palat1um1⁸
