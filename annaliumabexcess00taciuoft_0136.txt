to deal with them. It is in this mixture of strength and weakness ¹, as

Drusus superfuere.’

This period, the first eight years of this principate, treated by Tacitus
in the first three books, and reviewed at the beginning of the fourth, is at
once that on which his information is most full, and his estimate most
questionable : the whole time being thus summarily dismissed, not as that
in which the purpose was most sincere, but in which the disguise was best
sustained.

The fact of generally just and moderate government is admitted and
{indisputable We are told of constant consultation of the senate, even

on matters not strictly belonging to their cognisance³; that its chief
members are encouraged to discuss‚ and rebuked for servility *ς that the
office of the magistrates of the republic is respected ⁵ ; the laws‚ with one'
exception ⁶, uprightly administered3 that in the bestowal of dignities the
worthiest were selected; that Tiberius set an example of frugality‚ both
in the moderate size and number of his Italian estates, amid the vast villas
of the nobles ⁷, and in unostentatious management and retinue ; as well

abroad :that no new burdens were laid on the provinces; the old ones
η adjusted with care and remitted on occasion 3 personal violence and
confiscation scrupulously avoided; cruelty and extortion i'n governorsx
duly punished3 fiscal procuratorships conferred on men of character‚·
even without personal knowledge ; and their tenure indefinitely extended,
as if to diminish temptation to peculation, by giving men time to grow
rich without it. · Μ

to believe that Germanicus, whose chief recorded achievements are those
of mere ravage and massacre ⁸, or ostentatious and futile obsequiesj to the
