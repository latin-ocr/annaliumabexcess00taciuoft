which would be nearer to the Chauci
than the other winter camp.

turbidos. This is best taken in
its usual sense as ‘seditious' (cp. 34, 63
43, 5, ete), in which ease ‘et' would con-
tain an adversamve force (see note on c.
13, 2). On the use of‘et’ with a nega-
tive, instead of ‘neque‘ with an affirma-
tive pronoun or adverb, see Madvig, ξ
458 a, Obs. 1. Nipp. has collected many
instances to show the fondness of Tacitus
for such constructions‚ especially sor ‘ et '
with ‘nullus,' ‘numquam,' ‘ nihil‚’ and
‘nemo.’

1. legati. Their mission had proba-
bly no connection with the mutiny; but
was to convey to him the ‘proconsulare
imperium’ (cp. c. 14, 4).

⁴ regressum, i.e. from the upper army
(cp- c· 37, 4)-

aram Ubiorum. Some have con·
⁷ tended that this altar was not situate at
the ‘oppidum Ubiorum’ (Koln), but at
or near Bonn, which in 822, A. D. 69 (H.
4. 25, 1), was the winter camp of the first
legion. See Mr. Long in Dict. of Geog.
's.v. ‘Ara Ubiorum.⁸ But the subsequent
‘Colonia' certainly derives a title from
’ an altar situate in it, being styled in some

. inscriptions and coins ⁸ Claudia ara' or

'Colonia Claudia ara Agrippinensis’ (see
Marquardt‚ Staatsv. i. 121, n. 4, and ref.
there). Also the distance from ⁸ Vetera'
'(‘c. 45. 1) appears by correct measure-
ment more suitable to Koln. The altar
had a Cheruscan sor its priest (e. 57, 25,
and is believed to have been consecrated
to Augustus and Roma (see on c. 59, 6),

and to have been probably the centre of

this ‘cultus’ for the whole province:
see Marquardt‚ Staatsv. i. p. 121.
3. sub vexillo. It appears to be best
to take these words as ualifying ‘missi’
‘ita missi ut sub vexiilo retinerentur’).
e other explanation. joining ‘sub vex-
Ἴ5110 hiemabant‚‘ forces us to apply the
verb with. these words to the veterans,

N.-

and without them to the legions.

4. conscientia, ⁶ consciousness of
guilt,’ as in c. 57, 2, etc.

5. expresserant: cp. c. 19,⁴ 5, etc.

6. subdere ε cp. c. 6, 6, etc.

Plancum. His suu title in the
Fasti (as cos. in 766, A.D. 13, with C.
Silius) is L. Munatius L. f. L. n. Plancus.
He would appear to be son or grandson
of the famous consul of 712, Β. C. 42, so
well known in the history of the trium-
vimte, and so stigmatised by Velleius (a.
83). Plancina (2. 43, 4) was probably
his sister.

8. vexillum. The absence os any ex-
planation of this word suggests that the flag
is that already mentioned above (‘sub vex-
illo ¹). Germanicus is living in a house,
probably the regular winter residence of
the ‘legatus,’ and the soldiers assaulting
him are also outside the legionary camp.
It is suggested that these are the veterans,
whose ‘vexillum' Germanicus had sor
some reason retained in his own keeping.
This fact, and the arrival of the embassy,
might lead them to sear that their dis-
charge was a fiction, and might be re-
voked; and they may be supposed to
demand possession of their ‘ vexillum ' as
a guarantee. The legions, who had
received their money and had less
to lose, seem less prominent in this
outbreak, though even among them
Plancus was not( sase. The alternative
supposition, that the ‘vexillum' is the
red flag of the general-in-chief, by which
signal for battle was given (Caes. B. G.
2. 20, 1; Plut. Fab. 15, 182), would
make the demand for it imply an inten-
tion to elect a new general. of which
there is no evidence ς though Germanicus
(c. 43, 2) is represented as imagining such
an act in the case of his death.

situm = ‘positumss So used of
statues, etc„ c. 74, 43 2. 37, 35 4. 64, 3.
