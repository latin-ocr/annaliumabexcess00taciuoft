- Agricola ¹. The fulness of detail found in the description of all the
actions of Germanicus, and even of the progress of his remains to
Rome, and of the proceedings after his death, appears to suggest the
existence of some such special source of information 3 the more so
as he is known to have been accompanied in Germany by Pedo Albi-
novanus ², thd at the time of his death by another man of letters,
Vibius Marsus ³.

It was perhaps from such biographies that Tacitus enriched his
record of the scenes of the last years of Tiberius with cases unknown
to or unnoticed by his usual authorities ⁴.

Collections of letters, similar to those of the younger Pliny, may
also have been-made by public men; and the distinguished orators⁶

senate appears still to have been made public in the ‘acta populi ¹⁶3³

open to a senator. Though Tacitus refers to them at a later date ¹⁷, it
has been thought that for the earlier period he was for some reason.

where we should most expect a reference to them, other authorities
are cited ¹⁹. We have on the other hand references to extant speeches
