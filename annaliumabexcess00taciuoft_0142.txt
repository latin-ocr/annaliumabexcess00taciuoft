and the ‘bona‚' if not admitted to have been real before, must be sup-
posed less real now. Tacitus must be understood to mean that some evil
traits, such as cruelty and covetousness ¹, begin to escape their disgnise,
but that the appearance of many virtues is kept up.

The ascendancy of Seianus, greatly extended by the death of Drusus2,
is still so far held in check by Augusta as to require him to proceed
cautiously, and his bold request for the hand of Livia meets with a
deeided rebuff³. Yet, though only a knight, he appears to have already
some share in the ‘ proconsulare imperium ξ’ and has been able to carry
out a change more fraught with results in later Roman history than
perhaps any other event of this principate, the concentration of the
praetorians in the well—known barrack outside» the Servian ‘agger⁵:’ a
change at once attesting the influence of the minister, and the timidity
of the mter, who could be persuaded that so powerful a force on the
spot was necessary to his safety. Seianus 'is represented as already
steadily aiming at the throne: Drusus is out of the way, and the house
of Germanicus, though still personally secured, are represented as having
their position undermined by insidious attacks ὃ, and by the overthrow of
one friend after another ⁷.

This whole period is described in an eloquent passage as a dreary
chronicle of ‘ cruel orders, incessant accusations, treacherous friendships⁸.'
Under an exaggeration‚ similar to that of earlier passages ⁹, we discem
this truth, that the record of trials, mostly for state offences, is almost the ’
sole history of the time 3 and that, besides a large increase in the number
of such cases, from about twelve in eight years to about twenty in six ¹⁰,
we have also an increase in the espionage of informers and in the
severity of sentences.

Many distinctions must however be drawn. Serious charges were
brought, and some of them really proved, against Silius ¹¹, Serenus ¹²,
Lucilius Capito ¹⁸3 and the gratitude of the cities of Asia¹⁴ must be set
against the murmurs of Roman nobles. All would now respect the
indignant protest of Tiberius against leniency to Suillius, convicted of
