but does not seem to be constant to it in
any word (e. g. ‘luxui ' 14. 15, 3). Gellius
(4. 16) treats the question between the
forms in -‘ u’ and -‘ui‘ as an open one,
giving instances of the former not only
from Lucilius and Vergil, but from
Caesar; but, on the strength of a dictum
of Priscian (7, ξ 88), *that such forms
are poetical, editors (as Ritter 1864) have
sometimes corrected those in prose.
suberat tamen vigor, etc. The same
contrast of outward effeminacy and latent
energy is noted in Maecenas: cp. Vell. 2.
88, 2 ‘ubi res vigiliam exigeret, sane ex-
somnis, providens atque agendi scIens;
simul vero aliquid ex negotiis remitti

posset, otio et mollitiis paene ultra femi-7

natn fluens.’

2. mox. The death of Maecenas took
place in 746, B.C. 8 (Dio, 55. 7, 1). His
retirement from public affairs, alluded to
below and in 14. 53, 3 (cp. Suet. Aug.
66 ; Dio, 54. 19, 6), had taken place
eight years earlier.

3. interficiendi . . . Agrippae : cp.
1. 6, 6; 2. 40, 3.

6. fato. This appears to be a causal
ablative3 another alternative cause being
suggested by ‘ an satias capit ’ (cp. ‘ pa-
vore an· . . . retinens ⁹ 2. 38, 9) z ‘from the
fatality by which influence is rarely per-
manent, or because‚‘ etc. ‘ Fatum’ is
often with Tacitus assumed as a cause of
what he cannot explain (see Introd. iv.
p. 22); to which here, as in 13. 12, 2, the
alternative of some traceable cause is
added.

satias: cp.c. 54, 9; 6. 38, 1 ; 16. 16, 1.

classical.

illos . . . hos. ‘ the one . . . the other;'
i. e. the giver and the receiver, implied in
the sense. Such a mere gradual decay ⁴
of sriendship and influence as Tacitus
here notes is widely different from the
daily peril of imminent ruin, causing the
‘miserae magnaeque pallor amicitiae'
of the courtiers of Domitian (Juv. 4,

ΜΞ.. Tiberi quartus Drusi secundus:

see 2. 53, 1; 1. 55, 1. Dio (57. 20, 1)
represents people as already saying that
it was ominous to be consul with Tibe-
rius, a foreboding which the seqnel of
this and of his fifth consulship in 784,
A.D. 31, bore out3 it being a strange co-
incidence that, of all his colleagues, four
(Quintilius Varus, Cn. Piso, Drusus, and
Seianus) were known, and the fifth (Ger-

manicus) popularly believed, to have died ’ ¹

violent deaths. On the use of ⁶ colle-

thinks the whole sentence ¹ nam . . . fuerat' . ¹ “

an interpolation.

so close an association in respect of birth: ‚ . ς
The expression is inexact through brevity; Α ⁴

the meaning being that the association in ,
distinction was not then that of persons

of so near a natural relationship. For , 2
this sense of ¹ natura‚’ compare the phrase ¹
‘natura pater’ (Ter. Ad. 1. 2, 463 5. 7, ι
4). The word is here thrown in, because ,
Germanicus also was a son, but only by ’ 3

adoption.
