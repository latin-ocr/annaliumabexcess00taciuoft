His final departure was four years after

5. Domitius corbulo. This person,
who had already been ‘praetor‚’ and
would seem to have been somewhat el-
derly, can hardly be the famous general
(ep. 11, 18, etc.) who perished still in
the vigour of life forty-six years later, but

At the circus they had not reserved seats

Sen. 18, 633 and the rule (De Inv. 1. 30,

would thus appear, after having divorced
Lepida (cp. c. 23, 3), to have married
the widow of L. Sulla (cos. 749, B.c. 5),
who must have been his hals-brother on
the mother's side, and also father of this
Sulla. This wife of Scaurus may prob-
ably be the Sextia of 6. 29, 7.

rum,’ to whom these contractors were
responsible. These are distinct from the
board of four forming part of the vigin-
tivirate (Introd. vi. p. 77), whose sphere
of duties lay within the city. The chief
Italian roads appear each to have had
