ob scelus Antonii. Tacitus cares
to explain only their alienation from
Rome. Artavasdes I was son of Tigranes
Ι (the k1ng known in the campaigns of
Lucullus and Pompeius), and had reigned
some twenty years before his capture by
Antonius in 720, 13.C. 34: Dio, 49. 39, 43
Vell. 2. 82, 3. He was put to death by
Cleopatra, after Actium, to win the al-
liance of the Median king, his enemy
(Dio, 51- 5, 5)-

2. filius Artaxias. He had been made
king by the military chiefs on the capture
of his father, and though at first defeated,
had made good his position in the follow-
ing year: see Dio, 49. 39, 6; 40, 13 44,
4. He put to death all Romans in his
dominions (Id. 51. 16, 2).

4. occiso Artaxia, etc.: cp. Mon. Anc.
v. 24 ‘ Armeniam maiorem interfecto rege
eius Artaxia cum facere possem provin-
ciam, malui maiorum nostrorum exemplo
regnum id Tigrani regis Artavasdis filio,
nepoti autem Tigranis regis, per Ti. Nero·
nem tradere.' Josephus (Ant. 15. 4, 3)
represents Artaxias as expelled by Tibe-
rius. The date is that of the restoration
of the standards (see note on c. 1, 1) ;
and the statement of Augustus above,
that Armenia lay at his mercy, is magni-
fied into a conquest by Horace (Epp. 1.
12, 16) and Velleius (2. 94, 2), and in
coins of this date (see Momms. on Mon.
Anc. p. 77), bearing the legend ‘ Armenia
capta.'

record of this period has been reduced to

The children of this Tigranes 11, joined

in marriage and in regal power, were
Tigranes ΙΙΙ and Erato, who are record-
ed on the two sides of the same eoin, as

βασιλέως Τιγράνου ἀδελφή (Visconti, Pl. 5&

oggprtavasdea. This prince is un-
notieed in Mon. Ane. which speaks gene-
rally (v. 28) of a period of revolt (‘ gentem
postea desciscentem et rebellantem’). A
solitary coin is however extant, bean'ng
on the obverse the head and title of Ar-
tavasdes, and on the reverse the head of
Augustus, with the inscription θεοῦ Καίσα-
ρος Εὐεργέτου; which must belong to the
son of Ariobarzanes (see on ξ 3) or to
this king, to whom Prof. Percy Gardner
(Num. Chron. N. S. 12. p. 9-15) inclines
to refer it. Nip . thinks he may have
been a brother ο Artaxias and Tigranes
ΙΙ. Tigranes and Erato, who had been
set aside for Artavasdes, appear to have

inflicted this ‘ clades‘ and driven him out
with Parthian aid. The only evidence Ξ

os date is supplied by the statement that

Tiberius was to have been despatched to
deal with the Armenian revolt aster the
death of Tigranes, but for his retirement
to Rhodes, 748, B.c. 6 (Dio, 55. 9, 43
Zon. 10. 35, 363 p. 421, 422, Pind.).

Affairs were thus left unsettled till the* ’

mission of Gaius.
10. Gaius Caesar. He was in the

East from 753, Β. C. 1, till his death on

Feb. 21, 757, A-D. 4. Tigranes had fal-

len in battle with his neighbours, Erato .

again retired‚ and Phraataces was induced
to withdraw his support (Dio, 55. 10. a,

5)-
