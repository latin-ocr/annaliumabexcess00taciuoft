aut quo modo scribam aut quid omnino non scribam hoc tempore,

adeo facinora atque flagitia sua ipsi quoque in suppli-

cium verterant. neque frustra praestantissimus sapientiae firmare

and no more. For the few and short
passages in which Tacitus gives ‘ipsissi-

10. Ο. Caeciliano. The MS. has ‘ Cae-

of which is not without example, where
a title is added: see Nipp. on 5. 8, 1.
The person mentioned in 3. 37, 1 would
be styled ‘praetura functus' rather than
simply ‘ senator.’

1 2. Aruseium et Sanquinium, These
persons, and their accusation of Arruntius,
must have been mentioned in the lost
part. hence their brief designation here
by one name. This Aruseius is probably
not th'e one mentioned· m 0. 40, 1, as we
should suppose him to bein exile; and
the other name is uncertain, being w rit-
ten in the MS. as ‘Sangunnium,' which
Nipp. thinks may have been intended for
‘Sangurium,' a name found in C. 1. L. i.
1419. In any case he cannot be the per-
son mentioned in c. 4, 4.
