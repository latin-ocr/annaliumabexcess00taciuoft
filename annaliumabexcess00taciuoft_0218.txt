to be stronger than the simple verb.

8. sie melius audituros responsum,
‘ they replied that they would hear better
as they were,' i. e. crowding round him
in a mass. This refusal is contrasted with
the reluctant obedience (⁴ tarde obtem-
peravere ’) to his next order. On this
use of ‘sic‚’ cp. ‘sic quoque’ (4. 40, 4}

plains it by ‘ redimebat' (‘ compensated ’).

1. pro ‘riberie niti: cp. ‘nullo pro
Galba nitente’ H. 1. 55, 4.

seque et proximos. This is adop-
ted, after Haase, by Orelli and Halm, for
the MS. ‘seque proximos’ (see Halm,
Comm. crit ). The text of older editions,
‘ Sequanos proximos‚· couples a portion of
a single tribe to the whole province of
·Gallia Belgica;' while Nipp.'s reading,
‘ Sequanos, proximas et 'would necessitate
the explanation of ‘et’ as=‘etiam’ (as
‘aegro et corpore’ c. 4, 2, etc.), which no ‘signa cohortium' existed (see on c.
seems here without force. Germanicus 18, 3) ; but it is possible to suppose also

(see on c. 7, 3), such as his¹ainic5rum more readily be got at. To bring these

2. in verba eius. The ‘princeps,’ tively group themselves round them (see
though absent, is conceived as dictating c. 38, 4); and a kind of formation in

the oath of allegiance tos him. This is
the first instance on record, and probably
the first actual instance, of extension of
the ‘sacramentum,' notconly (as in c. 7,
3) to civilians, but even tmprovincials.
A similar course is mentioned as taken in
Syria on the death of Tiberius (J os. Ant.
18. 5, 3). For the practice later, see Pl.
ad 'grai 52. Cp. Mommsen, Staatsr. ii.

5. audiri coepere. On the use of the
inf. pass. with this verb, cp. Introd. v. ᾖ

fined to writers of this age, and appears

cohorts would result.

10. veneratione, ⁶ expressions of reve-
rence.’ The word is especially suitable
to a deified emperor, though not restricted
to such: cp. 12. 42, 3.

11. flexit. This verb is used intransi-
tively by Verg. Liv., etc. Its application
to a turn of speech (cp. 6. 15, 53 ¹3· 3,
π), or thought (cp. 4. 37, 2; 41, 2), ap-
pears to be Tacitean.

12. illis eum legionibus. In c. 42, 6,
the first and twentieth are particularly
mentioned. On the German campaigns
of Tiberius, see Introd. viii. pp. 114, 115.
