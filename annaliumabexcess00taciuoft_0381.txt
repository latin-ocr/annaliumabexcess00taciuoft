Such adorn- l

tration of Spain (c. 13, 2). This, like
the attack of Cicero on the ‘praetura
urbana' of Verres, could only bear on
the case by showing the general character
of the aecused.

9. cognitionem exciperet, ‘to take
up the case.' Thus Nero is said (14. 50,
2), by a similar interposition, ‘ suscipere
iudicium.’ On the force of ‘cognitio‚’

of the princeps, see Introd. v. p. 745

iudices. See Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p.
925. This form of anastrophe (see In-
trod. v. § 77, 3) is here very fully illus-
trated by Nipp. from Tacitus, as also
from Livy and poets.

14. qua . . . fama distraheretur, ‘the
reports by which his character was being
torn to pieces.' This appears here to be
the meaning of the word, which is else-
where used rather of a struggle or doubt
within the mind, as in 2. 40, 13 4. 40, 85
