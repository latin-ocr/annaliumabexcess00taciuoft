ence might seem still closer.
This comparison would lead us to conclude, that in such documents

Tacitus, while feeling at liberty to condense, rearrange, and generally to
deal with the form as he thought fit, and to assimilate the style and
language to his own for the sake of literary homogeneity, does consider
lhimself under an obligation to preserve the substance of what was really
¹{said‚ and that such passages are, to this extent, historical. though a much
¹smaller measure of truth may be supposed m less known or less famous
senatorial speeches3 and still less, or probably none, in such orations as
those os Calgacus to his countrymen ¹, or in the address of Germanicus
to the mutinous legions, or that to his friends around his death-bed ². .

Besides the emphatic profession of the historian’s obligation to impar-
tiality‚ we have to note the full belief of Tacitus that he has the means
of reaching truth, by weighing in the scales of justice the indiscriminate
praise or censure of earlier writers. He is more conscious of the difficulty
of writing on the Flavian Caesars, to whom he was personally indebted ³,
than on the period covered by the Annals, one in which, as he believed,
‘the grounds of resentment or partiality were far removed from him ⁴.¹

In one case, when he discusses and rejects a scandalous tale, he begs
the reader to take it as a specimen ⁶, implying that he has rejected many
other such3 which a comparison with Dio or Suetonius will sufficiently
confirm. A single instance may here deserve notice, from the attempts of
commentators to force it into compatibility with his narrative. Suetonius
tells a story,partly supported by Seneca ⁶ and the elder Pliny ⁷, that Tiberius,
when already princeps, spent thirty-six hours in a continuous drinking
bout with L. Piso and Pomponius Flaccus, both of whom were rewarded
for their boon—companionship——‘ alteri Syriam provinciam, alteri praefec-
turam urbis confestim detulit ⁸! But according to the text of Tacitus in
the MS„ Piso, at his death in 785, A. D. 32, had been twenty years prefect,
and had therefore held that office under Augustus ⁹. This is got rid of
.. by the supposition that twenty years is a round number, or that in some
earlier MS. in which numerals were used, ‘ xx ' and ‘ xv ' have been con·
fused. But the story limps elsewhere, for the appointment of Flaccus to

speaks as if he was following a tradition ⁸ Suet. Tib. 2. Seneca mentions only
(¹ in hunc modum locutus fertur '). that Piso had a 4habit of drinking; Pliny
