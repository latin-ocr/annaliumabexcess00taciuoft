126 INTRODUCTION. -

where condemnation was anticipated by suicide ¹. Confiscations also
now begin to appear, and so far bear out the imputation that an appetite Ι
for them has arisen ².

Traces of the better and greater side of his character still indeed re-
main, in the dignified address on the death of Drusus ³, energy in public
business ⁴, prompt investigation of a crime ⁶, strict repression of a
popular scandal⁶‚ resolute disdain of extravagant honours ⁷, munificence
on occasion of a public disaster Β. Much again of mere gratuitous in-
sinuation may yet be cast aside: such as that he was jealous of honour
paid to young Nero and Drusus⁹3 attended to public business only to
disarm suspicion ¹⁰; refused a temple from mere meanspiritedness ¹¹3 sup-
pressed mention of military disasters because he dared trust no one to
levy war ¹²3 and the like. The memoirs of the younger Agrippina are
once at least ¹⁸, and probably more than once ²⁴, laid under contribution,
with other matter which must be received with much reserve ¹⁵.

Stin, after all deductions made, there seems to be evidence that,
besides the increased sensitiveness to attack, already noticed, a change
is growing upon him, a consciousness of failing powers ¹⁶, in which even
the offer to resign may have been half-sincere ¹⁷, a growing dread of
conspiracies and of those in whose interest they might be supposed to ’
take place3 whereby the house of Germanicus, still in favour at the
beginning of this period ¹⁸, are on the brink of destruction at its close 11.
How far their conduct justified, or could be made to appear to justify,
such estrangement, can be never known. We can see that their position
was sufficiently secure at the outset to have made it their best policy
calmly to bide their time: we can also see that Seianus had an obvious
motive for insidious attacks on them,· and may even have forced them
to intrigue in sels-defence: and that, with or without such incentives,
the fiery and domineering nature of Agrippina ²⁰ may have made her play
only too readily into his hands.

These causes at any rate tended to promote the ascendancy of the only
real minister whom Tiberius ever had. It is by playing on these weak-
nesses that Seianus is represented to have induced him to take the great
step which marks the close of this period ς that of permanently withdraw-
ing from Rome ²¹, and fixing his headquarters in the natural island-
