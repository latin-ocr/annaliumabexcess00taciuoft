1. ultionem legis. ‘ enforcement of the

lem, which they had embezzled. On the

legal penalty‚’ i. e. that of ‘lex Iulia de Jsiac worship at Rome, introduced prob-

adulteriis' (cp. c. 50, 2). By this law he
was bound at once (under penalty of
being charged with eonnivance) to
{iiiiissiifigniffiYssfeissigdussifig’ti'eissii
sixty days exclusive right os proceeding
against her (Id. 11, ξ 6). Ν ipp. adds that
he was not usually liable to be called to
account sor not having exercised this
prerogative, even aster the sixty days had
expired, but that this whole case was re-
garded as exceptionally flagrant.

satis visum, repeated from H. 4. 59,
23 Liv. 7. 11, 9, etc.

de Vistilia statuere, ‘to deal with
Vistilia : ' cp. 6. 29, 2; 12. 54, 6, etc.

3. in insulam Seriphon. Such rele-
gation was part of the penalty of the ‘ lex
Iulia ’ (see on c. 50, 4). This island, one
of the Cyclades, now Serpho‚ was the
place of exile of Cassius Severus (4. 21, 5) ;
and, like GyarOS, is looked upon by
Jilivenal (10, 170) as typical of such
p aces.

4. de sacris Aegyptiis Iudaicisque
pellendis. Tacitus dismisses brieflya
subject of small interest to himself and
his readers, but Josephus (Ant. 18. 3, 4,
5) gives a full account of the circumstances
which appear to have led to these decrees.
A scandalous outiage had been committed
by a knight named Decius Mundus, on a
noble Roman lady named Paulina, in the
temple of Isis and with the connivance of
the priests ; and Tiberius had erucified the
priests, demolished the temple, and caused
the statue os Isis to be thrown into the
Tiber. At the same time a vagabond
Jew, with three accomplices, had per
suaded a noble proselyte named Fulvia to
send costly gifts to the temple at Jerusa-

ably soon after the second Punic war,
prevalent in spite of many attempts to
suppress it, and reluctantly tolerated by
Augustus outside the pomoerium (Dio,
53. 2, 4), see Marquardt, Staatsv. iii.
p. 76, etc. The settlement of Jews at
Rome is supposed to have begun with the
conquest of Pompeius ς they were cer-
tainly numerous in Italy in the time of
Cicero (pro Flacc. 28, 67), and are
noticed by Horace, Ovid, etc. See the
collection of references in Marquardt‚
Staatsv. iii. p. 81, Mayor, on Juv.14‚
96-106.

5 ea superstitione. Josephus repre-
sents this enlistment and explusion as re-
lating not to both these bodies but to f
Jews only. The large number of Jewish ³
freedmen‚ and the large Jewish settlement 1
in the trans-Tiberine district, are attested
by Philo, who also speaks of a persecu·
tion, but ascribes it to the influenee of ³

Seianus: Leg. ad Gaium, 23, 24, 568,

ν569 (= 1014,1015).

6. Sardiniam. Th1s island withCorsica, ⁴
had originally formedasenatorialprovince Ῐῑζ ᾗ
of the second rank, but, owing to the pre- ἐξ ⁴
valence of brigandage, alluded to also by 533
Varro (R. R. 1. 16, 2), was handed over i ,
to a procurator with amilitary force, from.
759, A. D. 6 (Dio, 55. 28, 1), until the
time of Nero (Introd. vii. p. 94). its
‘gravitas caeli’ had been already men-¹ ,ζ
tioned by Livy (23. 34, 11); Mela (2. 7,
123) calls it‘ ut fecunda, ita paene pesti· ²⁶
