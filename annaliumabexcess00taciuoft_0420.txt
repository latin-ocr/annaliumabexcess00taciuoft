ι. nobilissima Galliarum subole,
ete. The emendations proposed for the
MS. reading ‘nobilissimarum,' evidently
an error of assimilation, are numerous.
For a discussion of them, see Pfitzner‚ p.
193 Joh. Miiller‚ Beitr. sect. 3. p. 33.
Most editors adopt ‘ nobilissimam,’ with
a copulative particle; ⁴ occupaverat ' be-
ing taken by zeugma with ‘ subolem’ in
some such sense as that of ‘ copias occu-
pavisse ' (1. 10, ι). But it appears awk-
ward to introduce a new object after
an apparently completed sentence. This
would be in favour of Bezzenberger's sug-
gestion (followed by Nipp.) ‘ut nobilis-
simam ’ (followed by ‘ et eo pignore ’)‚ or
of the text above, adopted by Halm from
Heius. and Haase: a still nearer approach
might be made to the MS. by following
Miiller in resolving ¹ nobilissimarum ' into
‘ nobilissima cum.’ Some form of words
must clearly have been used which would
imply the acquisition of the parents and
relations, rather than of the youths, to be
the primary object.

school, which must have been founded by
Angustus made Augustodunum the great
Roman seminary in Gaul; as Massilia
(Strab. 4. 1, 5, 181) was the centre of
Greek culture. That the school still
flourished till the end of the third cen-
tury is attested by an oration of Eume-
nius, delivered when he was appointed by
Constantius to preside over it, on its re-
storation after the sack of Augustodunum
by barbarians (Panegyrici veteres, iii : see
also Lips. Exc. on this passage). ”

operata: so ‘conubiis arvisque novis
operata iuventus' (Verg. Aen. 3, 136; cp.
Hor. Ep. ῐ. 2, ²9)-

be taken as the sum of all the Aeduan

forces. At the rising of Vercingetorix
their first contingent, with that of those
subordinate to them, was fixed at 10000
foot and 800 horse, to which was added
a further levy of 3 5000 for the final crisis
(Caes. B. G. 7, 64; 75).

quinta. parte sui legionariis armis,
‘⁴ to the extent of one fifth, armed as legi·
onaries.’ ‘Le ionariis armis’ appears to
be rightly exp ained by Joh. Miiller and
Nipp. as an abl. of quality, similar to
‘ingentibus gladiis et brevibus cetris’
Agr. 36, 1, etc. (cp. Introd. v. § 29);
but there is an unusual harshness in its ·
immediate proximity to another abl„ that
of the part referred to.

6. gladiaturae, found nowhere else in
any author of repnte. ‘Lanistatura ’ oc-
curs in the * Tabulae Heraclaeenses: and
Drager notes that several such forms are
introduced in later Latin.

7. gentico, only found in 6. 33, 33
Tert. de An. 39.

cruppellarii. This Celtic word occurs
nowhere else] The same men are called
‘ferrati’ in c. 45, 3, and such a kind of
unwieldy plate armour (‘ cataphracta ’) ,4
is described as worn by Sarmatian chiefs 3,
in H. 1. 79, 5. The gladiators called ,ξ
‘mirmillones’ were supposed to repre· ‘31³
sent the usual Gaulish military equip- ³321
ment. ²

8. accipiendis inpenetrabiles. No χ
other instance of this construction appears ¹
to be found; but an ordinary dative (‘in-
penetrabilis irae ’) in Sil. 7, 561. ¹

9. ut...ita: cp. 1.12‚1,etc. 2

10. viritim, ‘of individuals.' Nipp. ζ
notes that in 11. 24, 2 ‘ singuli viritim’ j
stand in opposition to ‘terrae, gentes;'i= 1·
in Bell. Al. 65, 4 ‘et viritim et publice’÷ ζ
are contrasted: cp. ‘ipsum viritim' (‘him- . *
self individually') Vell. 2. 16, 3.
