instances in which a single word has the force of an abl. abs. are thus
explained, as visu 3. 14, 3, etc. (see Nipp. on 4. 51, 1). In some in-
mances, as leviore flagitio 1. 18, 5, such an abl. is a condensed sentence.

‘'29. The use of the ablativo of quality (as of the corresponding genit.
1166ξ 34) of persons, without the addition of a common name (see Madv.
287, Obs. 3), rare in Caesar, Cicero, and Livy, is common in T acitus3 as
artibus egregiis 1. 13, 1, etc. Cp. 1. 19, 2; 4. 29, 13 6. 48, 73 16. 18, 1.
often it expresses any circumstance attaching to a person or thing, as
, legionariis armis 3. 43, 23 mercennario milite 6. 34, 53 profectio arto
1 comitatu 4. 58, 1 3 testamentum multo rumore 3. 76, 2. Sometimes the
adj. is represented by a genit., as mariti animo 1. 57, 5 ; pacis artibus H.
ι. 8, 2. Dr. ξ 61. See Nipp. on 3. 433 763 Joh. Miiller, Beitr. 4.

' Ἀορ. 1. 76, 6; 3. 44, 4), and also of objective causes, as dissensione
gordinum 3. 27, 23 defectione 12. 10, 1; fervore 13.16,3; cohortatio-

'guibus 14. 30, 3. See notes on 2. 75, 15 3. 24, 5 (and Nipp. there). Dr.

³.ss 31. Some characteristic uses of the ablativo of attendant circum-
§moes or ablativo absolute, are to be noted.

z (a) sse use (ff a participle in this case as predicate, with a sentence as
{subject (Roby 1252). This usage, very rare before Livy, occurs never
{¹511 the minor writings of Tacitus, only six times in the Histories‚ but
frepeatedly 111 the Annals. Among the participles which Tacitus appears
