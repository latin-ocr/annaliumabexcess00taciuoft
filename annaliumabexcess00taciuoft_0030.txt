12 INTRODUCTION.

untruthfulness¹; and was therefore probably anti-Caesarian in its tone.
He is believed to have died early in the principate of Gaius, so that his
work must have been mainly composed before that time, and the death
scene of Tiberius, which he described ², may have been its elosing point.

Next to him, we have two names more distinguished, apparently the
best known writers of this period.

M. Sery‘iyli-u‘smNon-ianus, who was consul in 787, A.D. 35 ³, and died in
812, AB. 59, after a successful forensic career, wrote history in his
later years ⁴. We hear that Claudius himself carne to one of his recitals ⁶.
The elder Pliny once calls him the first man in the state⁶3 and Quin—
tilian, who had heard him, blames only his want of conciseness ⁷. The
period covered by his historical works is unknown, but he is supposed
to be the ‘vir consularis’ cited by Suetonius, as the authority for an
incident in the later years of Tiberius ⁸.

AUQQQS...B‚21.S.SUS2 though somewhat older than Nonianus ⁹, seems
to have died a year later ¹⁰. He wrote, besides a separate work on the
German wars‚ a general history, to which a continuation in thirty-one
books was written by the elder Pliny ¹¹, who also wrote another work,
in twenty books, on all the Roman wars in Germany ¹². Some at least
of the work of Bassus, in which the death of Cicero was described,
must have been extant in the time of Μ. Seneca ¹³, but it was probably
afterwards continued to a later date, perhaps to the time of Claudius,
as Pliny speaks of his own continuation of it as a ‘history of his own
times ¹⁴! .

The combined works of Bassus and Pliny would cover more than
the whole period included in the Annals¹⁵. Many facts are also known
to us through allusions in the Natural History of the latter author and
in the works of Seneca and of Josephus, and in the interesting contem-
porary view of Gaius given by Philo ¹⁶. But the chief authorities used

prodigies are noted in the last five, but

not in the earlier books of the Annals,
has been taken to indicate that Tacitus

to ‘ Seneca ς’ but L. Seneca is not known

whether Tacitus made any use of Philo,
