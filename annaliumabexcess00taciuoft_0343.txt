1. disiectas, ‘drifted.’ The general

‘ idea of the verb is tffii of dispersion (1.

32, 73 61, 33 c. 23, 3, etc.) ; though the
result in some cases as here, may be the
formation of almost impassable drifts in
places. Attention seems intended to be
drawn to the difficulty of building pyra-
mids on such foundation. They stand in
reality on a plateau of rock.

2. eductae: cp. 12. 16, 3, etc. This
sense of the word is Vergilian, and appar-
ently not found in earlier prose.

3. lacus, the lake Moeris of Hdt. (2.
· 14, 9), near Memphis. Tacitus appears
ζ77 to have thought that this and the pyramids
lay above Thebes.

st 5. inquirentium spatiis, ‘lengths of

line used by those who would sound it!
Hdt. (². 28, 6) mentions such a story,
himself believing that the lines were
cnsried away by the current ; as appears
to be the ease near the oetaract of Syene.

dary between Egypt and Nubia. Neither
Hdt. (2. 28, 29), nor Pliny (N. H. 5. 9,
1ο, 59), appear aware of the close proxi-
ᾗ mity of the two places.
6. claustra. not used as in c. 59, 4, but

Flacc. 13, 3o); ‘Etruriae'(Liv.9. 32, 1).
According to Strabo (17. 1. 12, 797),
three Roman cohorts were stationed here.

(the Ἐρυθρὴ θάλασσα of Hdt. 1. 180, 2,
etc.) ; where Trajan had formed a fleet to
operate against India (Eutr. 8, 3).

8. Dum ea aestas, etc. Though Ι
have not followed Nipp. in the actual
transposition, it vmust be admitted that
there is great force in the arguments cited
from Steup (Rhein. Mus. 24. 72) to show
that ch. 62-67 belong to the narrative of
the preceding year, and should be placed
before ch. 59—61. That year, rather than
this, is recorded as ‘ spent by Germanicus
in many provinces;’ Drusus had left for
Illyricum before the end of 770, A. D. 17
(cp. c. 44, 1 ; 53, 1), and is hardly likely
to have done nothing all the next year;

and again, the news of his success (c. 6 ‚ ·

that of the coronation of Artaxias (cp. c.
56, 3). The narrative is taken up from

The earliest notices os this people, from
Pytheas of Massilia, cir. Β. c. 300 (cited in
Pl. N. H. 37. 2, 11, 35), to Tacitus (G.
44, 1) and Ptolemy (3. 5, 5 20), place
them at the furthest limit of Germany on
the coast east of the Vistula. It would
be more natural to suppose the Celtic
