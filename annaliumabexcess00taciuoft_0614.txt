accus. agrees with the general usage of

he should advance against Tiridates ; but
Tacitus (Introd. v. ξ 12 c) ; but he always

much more probable that the geographi-

elsewhere uses this verb absolutely (as in
c. 4²· 4, etc.) or with dat. (e. 33, 5), and
would more naturally have used such an
expression as ‘Seleuciam propinquabat ’
(cp. 12. 13, 1), than the MS. text.

1. fama. atque ipso, ‘tde
the-plesenne ;’ so ‘ praemisso . . . legato
atque ipse . . . subegit ' (14. 26, 1). Nipp.
notes instances in which such an abl. is
used without a preposition‚ where not
strictly a person, but the fact of the pre-
sence of a person, is meant: as ‘ repentinis
hostibus circumventi ’ (15. 4. 4).

2. distrahi. On the historic inf. with
a6temporal conjunction, see Introd. v. §

3. festinati casus, ⁸ a speedy crisis!

8. Elymaeis. The best known peo-
ple of this name lived on the coast at the
head of the Persian Gulf: Polybius (5.
44, 9) and Ptolemy (6. 2, 6) also give the
name to a district or people os Media;
neither of which positions could be ‘a
tergo,’ in the same sense as Armenia. It is

and to understand that they were to be
got to harass the rear of Artabanus when

cal position of the Elymaei has been mis-
understood by Tacitus or those whom he
followed.

1 2. a gente Arabum. From the words
‘rex Arabum Acbarus,’ in 12. 12, 3, it
would appear that the people inhabiting
Edessa and its neighbourhood and the
country called by later writers Osrhoene

are here meant.
13. pudore . . . exsolvit, ‘defined

The subject of the Roman relations with
Parthia and Armenia is renewed by Taci-
tus in 11. 8, 1. Of the intermediate pe-
riod it is sufficient here to note that Mi-
thridates secured sor himself the kingdom
of Armenia; that Artabanus reestablished
his authority in Parthia and made peace
with Vitellius; and after experiencing
some further vicissitudes died in posses-
sion in 793, A.D. 40 (see Prof. Gardner,
as cited on 2. 1, 1), in which year the city
of Seleuceia successfully asserted its suu
independence (cp. 11. 9, 6). See Introd.
to vol. ii.

its chief force took the opposite direction,
