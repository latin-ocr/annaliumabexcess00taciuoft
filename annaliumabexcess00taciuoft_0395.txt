apertinerent. exemit etiam Drusum consulem designatum di-

adsentiendi necessitas fieret, quidam ad saevitiam trahebant:
neque enim cessurum nisi damnandi officio.

1. exemit . . . dicendae primo loeo
sententiae. On the dative with this
verb, cp. 1. 48, 2. A famous instance of
the old custom here alluded to is the
‘sententia’of Silanus as cos. design. on the
Catilinarians (Sall. Cat. 503 App. B. C.
2. 5). Appian there explains the practice
as grounded on the probability that the-
responsibility of executing the decree
ῗέἕῖξζαιὲῗῗυι ῗῗ ἕξ {221152 Υέἓέςῃξξίἓῗέῗ
their position, which, while not entitling
them as magistrates to speak unasked
(cp. e. 17, 8), was yet quasi-magisterial.
Thus Cicero (ad Q. F. 2. 1, 3), when the
tribune had already asked the consul-
designate‚ says ‘de privatis me primum
sententiam rogavit! For other instances‚
ἕλο- 49, 4; 4 42‚3; 11·5‚ 3³ 1448,

3. trahebant: cp. 1. 62. 3.

4. neque enim, etc„ ‘he would not
have devolved on others any duty but
that of condemning‚’ i. e. is he had in-
tended the vote to be for acquittal‚ he
would gladly have made Drusus its spokes-
man. On the ellipse of ‘fuisse‚‘ see In-
trod. v. 39 c. ⁸ Officio ' is abl.; the eon-
structiou being like that of ‘possessione
cedere: etc.

5. ludorum diebus. In the absence
of any specification, it is probable that
the ‘Ludi Magni Romani are meant;
wh'ich began Sept. 4, and lasted, under
one or another name, to the 19th. For
four days (cp. Liv. ²4· 43. 7) they were
mic, during most of the latter days
circensian. See Marquardt‚ Staatsv. iii.
1³1>- 477· 478· ·

cognitionem intervenerant. The
accusative is not elsewhere found with
this verb, but is analogous to that with
{mterfluere' (2. 9, 1) and other such
verbs (Introd. v. 12 c). The interruption

of judicial proceedings by these games
may be gathered from Cicero (Verr. 1.
10, 31), who deducts forty days, chiefly for
the games vowed by Pompeius and for
the Ludi Romani.

7. ea monimenta . . . visebantur, i.e.
‘ cuius erant ea . . . quae visebantur? A
single building might be called ‘ moni-
menta’ (c. 72, 13 4. 7, 3); but other
buildings, the Curia and Porticus Pompeii,
were close by. This theatre‚ the greatest
in Rome, was also the first permanent
structure of the kind in the city, and
considered a great innovation by severe
Romans (see 14. 20, 2). It dates from
the second consulship of Pompeius, 699,
B.C. 55. For an account of it, see Dyer
(in Dict. of Geog.) pp. 834, 8443 Burn,
Rome and the Campagna, p. 318.

8. permovit. On the accus„ cp. 1.
21, .

9.4detestanda=‘detestabilia,’ as in
4. 69, 33 16. 28, 2, etc.

10. obscurissimae domui: see c. 48,
2. Quirinius is, however, there shown to
have been a man of distinguished public
career, and no imputation is cast on his
general character. Nor does the popu-
lar sympathy with Lepida appear really
to rest on anything but her rank, and
on the long interval of time, perhaps
capable of explanation, between some, at
least, of her crimes and her trial. Tacitus
admits her guilt (c. 22, 3), and yet seems
to lean towards this sympathy. The
whole narrative thus aptly illustrates the
popular respect for noble birth still preva-
lent under the Empire, as shown by
Horace (Sat. 1. 6, 7 foll.), and, much
later, by the energy with which Juvenal
(Sat. 8) protests against it. See Introd.
