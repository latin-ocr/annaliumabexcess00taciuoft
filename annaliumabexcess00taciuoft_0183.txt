1. per conamen, etc. On the ad-
ministration during the vacancy of the
principate, see Introd. vi. p. 83. On the ·
position of Tiberius at this time, see

that shown by Augustus himself to the
remains of Drusus (3. 5. 2).

7. signum= ‘sstesseram as 13. 2, 5,
etc. At the death of Gaius this was

Introd. viii. p. 120.

2. ambiguus imperandi,‘ as if he
had not made up his mind to rule:' cp.
ambiguus consilii’ (H. 2. 83, 2, etc). On
this genitive, see Introd. v. ξ 33 e γ.. Dr.
notes that its use with‘ ambiguus‘ is new
in Tacitus, but analogous to that with
‘dubius' and‘ incertus’ in Livy.

4. praescriptione, ‘ under the title of.'
Nipp. notes that the edict would run thus:
⁴ Ti. Caesar trib. pot. xvi. dicit? On the
special powers of dealing with the senate
conferred by this title, see Introd. vi.
p. 71, · Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. pp. 859,
1105,1107.

posuit. This verb is used for‘ pro-
ponere' only here and 4. 27, 1. On
other such uses of simple verbs for com-
pound, see Introd. v. ξ 40.

6. neque abscedere. These words are
added to excuse his absence from Rome.
Τὴε body os the princeps might be re-
garded as in charge os the state, and the
attendance on it might thus be taken (as
in Nipp.) to be a ⁴ publicum munus‚’
though these words apply better to this
summoning of the senate. The edict was
issued at Nola3 whence the body was
borne by local magistrates at each stage
to Bovillae, and thence to Rome by
knights on the day before the senate met
(Suet. Aug. 1003 yDio, 56. 31, 2). The

’ respect paid by Tiberius was similar to

 

given by the consuls (Jos. Ant. 19. 2, 3);
but the action of Tiberius may be ex-
plained by his being · consors imperii?

8. excubiae. A cohort of praetorians
kept guard at the house of the princeps
and attended him elsewhere (H. 1. 24, 2 ;
29, 2), but dressed only in the toga. (Id.

cetera aulae, ‘ the other accom-
paniments of a courum
ally used by Tacitus of the ‘ cohors ' or
courtiers, as 2. 43, 5 ; H. 1. 13, ιο.

10. eum . . . loqueretur. On this sub-
junctive, see Introd. v. 5 52.

11. praecipua. He had also similar
fear of the Pannonian legions; and others
bring in here the plots, supposed to be
already in progress, of Libo (2. 27) and
Clemens (2. 39). Suet. Tib. 25.

13. apud populum favor: see 2. 41 ;
82; 4· 57, 5-

14. dabat et famae, ‘it was his con-
cession to public opinion.’ The full ex-
pression * das aliquid famae ' ? is found in
Hor. Sat. 2. 2, 94. The accusative, here
alone thus omitted with ‘ dare? is not unfre-
quently absent from ‘ tribuere:' the object
here is supplied from‘ ut. .videretur‚’
asina. 53, 33 58‚1,etc.:
for public opinion, 4. 40, 1, etc.

15. senili, overstated, as Augustus was
only sixty- -five at the time of the adoption.
The share of Livia in it is dwelt upon in

‘fama’ is used ,
