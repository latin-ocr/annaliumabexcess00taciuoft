praesentia: cp. 1. 30, 5, etc.
1. decrevere . . . decora: cp. ‘ decora
. . tribui’ c. 5, 4. The word hardly
seems used in contrast (as Doed. thinks)
to the ‘ indecora adulatio ' of Dolabella.

2. Dolabella. Cornelius. P. Cor-
nelius P. f. P. n. Dolabella was cos. in
763, A. D. 10 (C. Ι. L. i. p. 550): a
Dalmatian inscription (Orelli 2365) re-
cords him as one of the ‘septemviri
epulones’ and ‘sodales Titii‚' as well as
legatus of Augustus and Tiberius (in
767, A. D. 14) in that province (cp. Vell.
2. 12 5 5). He was proconsul of Africa
in 777, A. D. 24 (4. 23, 2). Some other
inscriptions referring to him are cited by
Nipp p., who thinks him to have been
father of the friend of Galba (ῌ. 1. 88,
1). Other extravagant‘ sententiae’ pro-
posed by him are given in c. 69,1; 11.
22, 3: in 4. 66. 2 118 is mentioned as
going out of his way to accuse a near
relation.

5. ferocissimas gentes perdomitas,
etc. See Introd. viii. pp. 113-115. Vel-
leius (2. 122, 1) alleges, that although he
was contented with three triumphs, he
could have claimed seven.

9. Sulpicii Quirini:

3 piiblieis exsequiis. It was the opinion
of Lipsius that any ‘indictivum funus’
(Festus, etc.), i. e. any to which all were
summoned by public notice, might be
called ‘ publicum;’ but the term is evi-
dently restricted to the funerals of those
who, for their services, were buried at
the public cost. Thus Velleius (2. 62, 4)

see c. 22, 13 2.

Maximus (5J 2, 10), ‘praetore funus
Hirtio et Pansae iussu senatus locante!
On the question whether the same is
meant by ‘ censorium funus,’ see 4. 15, 3.

10. frequentaretur, ‘ should be cele-
brated! Tacitus has ‘celebrare mortem'
(6. 27, 2); and ‘frequento' has the
general sorce of ‘ celebro,' and may be
predicated even of a single person (14. 4,
1, etc.)

properly used of the funeral than of the .

8, etc. This gens, though chiefly patri· ‘⁴

cian, had noble families of both orders,
the ‘ Camerini, Galbae, Rufi‚’ etc.

1 2. impiger. The relative genitive with
this word, found only here and H. 1. 87,

4, is analogous to many others (Introd. v.

§izi-ihil} ministeriis. Certain suc-

cesses over the Garamantes and Mar-
maridae of Libya, ascribed to Quirinius

by Florus (2. 31=4. 41), are assigned by .

Mommsen (Comm. on Mon. Anc. App.

p. 119, 120) to a time before his consul- g ,
ship. when he may have been praetorian j

proconsul of Cyrene.

would have been gained by him during ².

his tenure of that province, with which a

vexed question of chronology (St. Luke 2. 3
