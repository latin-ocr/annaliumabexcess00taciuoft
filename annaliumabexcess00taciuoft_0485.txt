These were offered on a fixed day, shown
by later authorities (Gaius, Dig. 50. 16,
223 ; Plut. Cic. 2, etc.) to be Jan. 3, and
must not be consounded with those offered
for the state on Jan. 1 (c. 70, 1). The
present year was a special occasion, as
the ‘ decennium' of Tiberius (Dio, 57.

they took the whole blame on themselves,
they were not severely rebuked. The
mildness of the censure is explained by
the sentence ⁴ etenim . . . erant?

On this interchange, cp.
