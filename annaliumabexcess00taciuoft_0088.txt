70 INTRODUCTION.

of the whole Roman world, that the whole senate and people, and even the
provinces, take the ‘sacramentum' in his name, binding themselves in the
most solemn terms to maintain his authority against all enemies, and not to
hold even their own children dearer ¹. Naturany, in time the ‘imperator '
and ‘ princeps ' became synonymous ², and this power was held sufficient-
in itself to constitute a principate ; and, although formally given by
senatorial decree, retained a fatal memory of the old popular or military “
origin of an ‘ imperator’s ' title ³, and of the irregular command of
Augustus ‘ by universal consent ζ’ out of which this form of ‘imperium '
had risen; so that even a constitutional ruler like Vespasian takes the
salutation and ‘ sacramentum ’ of the soldiers as a valid title, and reckons
from it, not from the senatorial decree, his ‘ dies accepti imperii ⁵.' Hence
the revelation of that ‘ state secret' so fruitful in subsequent history, that
⁶ a “princeps’' could be made elsewhere than at Rome ⁶;' and hence the
‘imperator,’ even in profound peace, felt that ‘he held a wolf by the
ears ⁷‚' and was safe only as long as the soldiers were contented.

ΙΙ. The tribunitian power added a civil and urban magistracy to the
military command ; and was not, like the formal office of tribune, un-
tenable by a patrician. Gracchus and others had shown the formidable
¹ political strength of the tribunate‚ not only as regarded its wide and
indefinite coercive powers, but also in its legislative initiative. Experience
'had no less shown its inherent weaknesses, the liability to paralysis by
the veto of a colleague, the annual tenure with a doubtful chance of
re·election, and the want of armed support in case of the last appeal to ι
force. But from the tribunitian power of the Caesar all these weaknesses,
ἵ were removed. The tribunes of the year were in no sense his colleagues, .-
and their voice ‘was powerless against his ⁸3 the office was held for 1ife;
and the power of the sword wasknown to be in reserve. This office
also retained memory of its popular origin ; for the decree of the senate
conferring it was only preliminary to a ratificatory ‘lex ’ or ‘plebiscite,’
which survived even the general abolition of the comitia ⁹. A fragment
