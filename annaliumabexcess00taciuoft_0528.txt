narrative, as in 14. 8, 4; Liv‚ 41. 3, 5;
44. 24, 1 ; in Cic. Acad. Pr. 1. 1 the verb
can be supplied from a sentence above;
in Sall. Jug. 100. 1 the soundness of the
text is not unquestioned; in none of these
instances is the idea of the verb, as here,
the prominent thought of the whole pas-
sage; which is therefore more likely to
have run here asin 3. 31, 2.

1. apud capuam Iovi. This temple,
placed on a Capitol at Capua resembling
that of Rome, is called ‘ Capitolium' in
Suet. Tib. 40.

apud Nolam Augusto, on the spot
where Augustus had died (cp. 1. 9, 1);
Dio says (56. 46, 3) ἡ ἐν τῇ Νώλῃ οἷ-
κία, ἐν ᾗ μετήλλαξεν, ἑτεμενῖσθη. In per-
sonally consecrating these, Tiberius prob-
ably acted as ‘pontifex maximus: see
note on 2. 49, 2.

certus, this use with the inf. is poet-
ical (Verg. Aen. 4, 564, etc.): see note
on e. 34, 2.

2. causam . . ,rettuli, ‘ Ι have referred
the cause:’ so in 6. 49, 2. The suggest-
ions of Seianus have been mentioned in c.
41, 2. On the reasoning of Tacitus, see
Introd. iv. p. 26 ; viii. p. 126. He ap-

. pears here to overlook the probability

that the original retirement may have
been due to one cause, its continuance to
another.

4. coniunxit. The expression is prob-
ably equivalent to ‘ sex annos continuos
mansit in secreto‘ (Gerber and Greef, Lex.)‚
and akin to 6. 26, 3, rather than to c. 33,
3. ‘Secreto’ could be taken as abl. of

quzllletzhmque permoveor, ‘ I often
hesitate! Drager notes a similar brachy-

logy in Cic. Clu. 37 ‘adducti sunt iudices

(‘were induced to believe ’) non modo Ρ l
tuisse,’ etc.: cp. Att. 11. 16, 2. 1ῗῖ
7. habitum: cp. on 1. 10, 7. Η“’“,ῐ;’
pexsonal appearance is described by S· ’ ’
tonius (Tib. 68) without reference to ι ι ¹
particular time of life. His bearing Γ ”
there recorded as stiff and erect; · ⁸ ,ᾗ
countenance as liable to ⁸ crebri et subi
tumores‚' mentioned as a specific dise ².
by Galen (περὶ συνθέσεως φαρμ. 5, 12 A*
That his features were otherwise han >t
some and distinguished, is stated by S -’ ζ,
tonius, and evidenced by his coins «ι ᾗ
other representations, especially the ⁶ ’ἕ
mous sitting statue in the Vatican (M ’”
Chiar. 400). ¹.
9. medicaminibus interstincta, ‘wi ¹
patches of plaster:’ cp. ‘candore in —
stincto . . . coloribus’ Pl. N. H. 37· ²

Rhodi: depending on ‘secreto.’ ⁸, ξι

10. recondere voluptates, ‘ to con υἱ Ἰ

son for his retirement is also given ,ζ
Suet. (Tib. 51) and Dio (57. 12), in ι »ς ἶ]
of whom stories of their quarrels may'- ᾗ
found. The memoirs of rAgri pina ζ, ἑ
on c. 53, 3) were doubtless suli of ’ξ
material. -’ ”’
1 2. depellere, sc. ‘ a dominationis 1 · f
