tempdral but a causal connection is indi-

cated: cp. c. 50, 1; 54, 3; 2. 8, 3; 88,
43 3. 19, 3; 6. 7, 6. etc. See Drager,
Synt. and Stil, ξ 168, and a complete

cognomento Sirpicum. ‘ Cognomen-
tum' usually denotes a real name (cp.
2. 9, 2 ; 60, 3, etc.)‚ and Nipp. appears
rightly to contend that such is here
intended, though no such name as ‘Sir-
picus’ is otherwise known: a niglsuame
would probably have been explained, as
‘cedo alteram‘ above, or ‘Caligula,’ e.
41, 3-

1. morti deposcit, ‘demands for
death,' i.e. ‘with a view to his death,'
On this dative of work eontemplated,
see Introd. v. 5 22 c; also note on c. 51,
4. and Madv, 5 249.

3. abstrusum, ‘ reserved.' This word
appears to be only here used of persons.
Similar uses of ‘tectus‚’ ‘occultus‚’ etc.
arehfrequent in Tacitus, but less peculiar
to im.

5. primoribus civitatis. This term
is used in 3. 65. 2, in contradistinction
to the mass even of consulam, and prob-
ably implies family nobility as well as
personal rank. One of those sent on

· this occasion is mentioned by name (c. 27,

1), Cn. Lentulus.

6. nullis satis certis mandatis.
Nipp. notes that Tacitus often tolerates
three ⁴ homoeoteleuta‚' as in c. 5, 5 (‘pr0-

eris matris literis ')‚·and in one place
ve, ‘ignis, patulis magis urbis locis’
(15. 40, 2).

ex re consulturum, ‘to decide ac-
cording to circumstances :⁵ so ‘ex me-
moria’ (2. 63, 1); ‘ex delicto ‘ (3. 27, 2);
and, the common expressions ‘ex senten-
tia, etc.

7. delecto, i. e. chosen from the other
cohorts.

8. praetoriani equitis. On this force, -
see Introd. vii. p. 107; also Marquardt,
Staatsv. ii. 462.

Germanorum. A body os Batavian
horsemen had been attached to the per· ”
son of Augustus (Dio, 55. ²4- 7). Thes'e
and any other Germans of the bodyguard
had been dismissed after the defeat of
Varus (Suet. Aug. 49), but had evidently
been already restored. A similar force is
mentioned under Gaius iSuet. Cal. 43),
and Nero (13. 18, 43 15. 58, 2), but their
dismissal by Galba (Suet. Galb. 12) was
probably final, as Tacitus speaks of them
in the past. Marquardt (Staatsv. ii. 471)
refers to several inscriptions showing that
they were not slaves, yet not strictly con-
sidered soldiers, not being organized in
‘ centuriae ’ or ⁴ turmae,' but as a ‘ colle-
gium ³ divided into ‘ decuriae!

9. Seianus. Here first mentioned.
His early history is given in 4. 1. His
father has been mentioned (c. 7, 3).

10. collega. Maecenas is represented
(Dio, 52. 24, 1) as advising Augustus, as
a measure of safety, to share the ⁸ praesec-
tura praetorii' between two; and this
was generally the rule, though with many
exceptions, such as the sole command
later of Seianus, of Macro, of Burrus (l 2.
42, 2), Arrius Varus (H. 4. 2, 1), etc.
All other ‘praefecturae' were adminis-
tered by a single praefect: see Momm-
sen, Staatsr. ii. p. 831.

1 1. rector iuveni. On the dative, see
Introd. v. ξ 19.

ceteris periculorum praemiorum-
que ostentator, ‘ to hold before the
rest their perils and rewards.' ‘Ceteri'
must apparently refer only to the troops
sent from Rome, as the legions do not
