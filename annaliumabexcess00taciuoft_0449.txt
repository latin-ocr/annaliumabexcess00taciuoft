1. sine cultuhominum. Pliny (H. N.
J 8. 29, 43, 104) gives a story srom Varro,
tho apparently had it from Theophrastus
(id. 57, 82, 222), os its desertion through
'33 plague of mice. In 4. 30, 2 it is called
Jdoetitute os water. Strabo, however, re-
conis (10. 5, 3, 485) that at the time of
75Actium he found there a village of fisher-

eastern boundary of Africa at ‘ Philaeno-
rum arae ' (Introd. vii. p. 97) to the fron-
tier of Egypt, coinciding with the eastern
half of modern Tripoli. Josephus (Ant.

a fourfold division of the population: 1.
πολῖται (Greeks); 2. γεωργοί (Libyans):
3. μέτοικοι; 4. Ἰουδαῖοι. These latter were
a large body (cp. Acts 2, 10).

6. Caesius Cordus. Respecting him
and Ancharius Priscus, cp. c. 38, 1. It
is probable that the accusers had de-
manded a year for collecting evidence
