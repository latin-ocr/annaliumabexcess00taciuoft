duodecim. This may be presumed
to date from the defmt of Varus ; so that
his death must have taken place in 774,
A. D. 21, though mentioned here, as on
the last ocmsion of noticing him, Maro-
bo'duus was thus dismissed from notice
c. 6 i.
( 1. 3eain-ittaque. It is suggested by

Jac. Grimm (Mythol.p 326, cited by
Orelli), that Tacitus here confounds him

. with th? German hero Irmin (see note on
c. 12, 1 .

2. Graecorum. The spirit of these

. Greek annalists may perhaps be repre-

sented in the subsequent narrative of Dio,

, who only once (56. 19, 2) mentions

Arminius. It is impossible to say, whether
ν Tacitus may here have alluded to, or could
ever have seen, the works οἱ his contem-
porary Plutarch, who certainly wrote lives
of Augustus and Tiberius.

in 13. 47, 2; 14.19; as also perhaps

‘alacris' (corr. in H. 5. 16, 5), and in

earlier prose writers ‘acris' ‘equestris,’
‘salubrisss ‘silvestris· cp. Zumpt, Gr.

vetera extollimus. A similar pro-
test against indiscriminate admiration of
antiquity is found in 3. 55, 6. The senti-
ment of Velleius (2. 9²· 4), ‘praesentia
invidia praeterita veneratione prosequimur,
et his nos obrui illis instrui credimus‚‘ is
transferred by Hobbes (Leviathan, con-
clusion) from the judgment of actions to
that of literature: ‘The praise of ancient»-
authors, proceeds not from the reverence
of the dead, but from the competition andix
mutual env) of the living?
