ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ‘LEX PAPIA POPPAEA: 443

specific thing with children, in the second place to heirs with children, in
«the third to other legatees with children ¹, failing all these, to the aera-
rium ², or, in later times, to the fiscus.

This law, though having for its apparent object ‘to add force to the
penalties on celibacy and to enrich the treasury ⁸‚’ encountered no such
vigorous opposition as that which had blunted the edge of the ‘lex
Iulia ⁴.' The senate had been schooled by twenty-five years of submissim,
and people had perhaps found out that it was easier t'o evade laws than

f to resist their enactment. The consuls from whom this law is named
l were both unmarried⁵ ; nor, according to Tacitus ⁶, did marriage or the
ξ rearing of children become more frequent.

ᾗ In one respect the law was indeed most fruitful. By it was given the
ς first general encouragement, on a large scale, and in a matter affecting
{private life, to systematic delation ⁷, and the first brood of professional
informers was called into being; whose activity in respect to other laws‚
1 and especially that of ‘ maiestas: forms so large a part of the domestic
history of the age. When this activity was let loose upon a law whose
vast and complicated network was such as to entangle every family in
some or other of its meshes ⁸, we can easily see that its working must
have caused intolerable annoyances unforeseen at its enactment, and can
3 understand the outcry which in ten years was already demanding relaxa-
, tion. The law itself thus marks the *extreme limit of legislative interfer-
ἶ enee with private life in this respect, and its Subsequent history as known
Ὶι to us is that of · its mitigation. ‘ Many of its entanglements were
resolved’ by the commission under Tiberius ⁹, another important pro-
ἶ vision was relaxed by Claudius-1⁰, the rewards of informers were cut down
ι, byNero ¹¹, and princes often gave the ‘ ius liberorum' to those who had it
{³ not ¹². Thus the severity of many of its penalties became so far obsolete

 

‘1 ¹ Hence Juvenal says (9, 87) to one

Claudius repealed, is unconfirmed and ap-
