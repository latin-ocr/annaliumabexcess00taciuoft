tence in the abl. abs ‚ of which ‘ turbidis,'
in an active sense, forms the predicate;
and which explains ‘ non in longum, ' ‘ the
proposals of Lepidus immediately throw-
ing all into disorder.’ M. Lepidus, father
of the triumvir, proposed, as consul in
676, Β. C. 78, to rescind various enact·
ments of Sulla. His speech and that of
Philippus in reply to him are among the
extant fragments of Sallust. On his in-
surrection and death, see Mommsen,
Hist. B. v. c. 1.

6. neque multo post. In 684, B.c. 70,

‘M. Crassus et Cn. Pompeius consules
tribunitiam potestatem restituerunt’ (Liv.
Epit. B. 97): i.e. they restored what
Sulla had taken away. Cicero (de Legg.
3. 9) describes Sulla with approval, ‘ qui

describes the people as ‘ agitandi inops'

Mommsen shows, especially from the
⁸ plebiscitum de Thermensibus,’ passed in ¹
683, Β. c. 71 (Inscr. Orell. 3673 ; C. I. L.
i. 204), that the tribunes could consult
the people‚ but, apparently, only with
consent of the senate, as the formula ‘de
senatus sententia’ is added (Hist. B. iv.
c. 10, p. 364).

8. in singulos, i. e. ⁸ peregia? The
laws of the Twelve Tables ‘ in privatos

by the bill of Clodius in 696, B. C. 58,
appears here to be especially alluded to.
