1. Germanicae legiones. The pro-
vinces of ‘Germania Superior' and ‘ In-
ferior' consisted chiefly of German tribes
transplanted to the left bank of of the
Rhine. On their northern and eastern
frontier‚ see Introd. vii. p. 93. Though
not always distinguished from Gallia
Belgica they were certainly at this date
separately governed‚ and parted from it
by the line drawn between Germans and
Gztuls, which in Upper Germany coin-
cided mostly with the Vosges, in Lower
Germany partly with the lower course of
the Scheldt (Pl. N. H. 4. 14, 28, 98). The
two provinces were parted from each
other by the Nahe (Nava), or perhaps
the Mosel; and the two headquarters of
government were at Koln and Mai'nz, the
latter of which is erroneously assigned to
Lower Germany by Ptolemy, whose ac-
count (2. Ῑο) appears to be inaccurate in
other respects (see Dict. of Geog. s.v.
‘Obringas'). For further account. see
Marquardt, Staatsv. i. p. 120, foll, and,
on the legions Introd. vii. p. 103.

4. tracturis. On this concise use of
the future participle. see Introd. v. § 54 d.
The MS. text ‘ tracturus ‘ has been gene·
rally thus corrected; ‘sua,’ here, as at
the end os this chapter, being more pro-
perly referred to the legions; and ‘tra-

here' being elsewhere used (cp. ¹ tractis’

below, and H. 2. 86. 4; 3. 44, 1) os

troops inducing others to follow their
lead.

5. C. silio. He had been eos. in 776.
A. D. 13; and received the ‘triumphalia’
later (c. 72, 1), On his subsequent
achievements, see 3. 42, 2, etc.; on his
trial and death, 4. 18; 193 on his son's
share in the infamy of Messalina, 11. 12,

igitur audito 4

etc. The poet Silius Italicus may have
been related to him.

6. A. Caecina.. As legatus os Lower
Germany. he must have been of consular
rank; he also received· triumphalia' (c.
72, 13, was a veteran soldier (c. 64 13,
and had won distinction ln Pannonia and
Moesia in 759. 760; Α. D. 6, 7(Vell. 2.
112, 4; Dio, 55, 29-32). He is subse-
quently mentioned with the cognomen

‘Severus’ (3 18, 3: 33, 13.

regimen summae rei. Silius and
Caecina were the‘ legati Augusti proprae-
tore’ in the two‘ Germaniae& Germani-
cus had· proconsulare* imperium ⁷(see on
c. 14, 43 over these and the Gaulish pro-
vinces.

7. agendo Galliarum censui. ‘·cen
sum agere’ is a common phrase (14. 46,
2; Liv. 3. 22, etc.3, as also‘ censum acci-
pere' (c 33, 1), of those who received the
returns of property which the subjects had
to furnish (‘ censum deferre: as 6. 4,1 1,
etc). On such returns would rest ’the
applortiopimesnt pfgae ξηέῐ ῐῖἱδιιῑε os slortly
mi ion .., ai on au asawoe
(Suet. Jul 2 5). The first systematie cen-
sus os Gaul appears to have been held by
Augustusin 727‚13.c ²7 (Dio, 53. 22, 5),
and revised by Drusus in 751, Β. c. 13
(Liv. Epit.136; 137; ‘Oratio Claudii’ sub
fin.;) and again revised now, and later
(2. 6, 1; 14. 46 2). See 'Marquardt,
staatsv. ii. p. 204. '

12. Ubiorum. This tribe, which in the
time of Julius Caesar lived beyond the
Rhine, but had been already assimilated
to Gallie civilisation (B. G. 4. 3, 3), was
transplanted‚ with its own consent, by
Agrippa (12. 27, 2; G. 28‚5 ·.Strab 4
