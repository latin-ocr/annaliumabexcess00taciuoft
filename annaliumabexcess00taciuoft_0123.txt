ROME UNDER AUGUSTUS AND TIBERIUS. 105

The old names ‘hflsstati‚' ‘principes‚' and ‘pilani‚' survive¹; and,
though no longer designating any difference of equipment‚ denote pre-

³,- cedence in honorary rank. Each cohort contained two centuries‚ or one
⁷ maniple, of each of these ς and the cohorts also rank in honour accord-
* ing to their number. This hierarchy of rank serves to place the sixty

centurions in a constantly ascending series²; the maniple, rather than
the century, being the unit of the legion, and being under the command
of the first of its two centurions. The lowest centurion would thus be
the subordinate centurion of the ‘hastati ' of the tenth cohort‚ styled

Α ‘ decumus hastatus posterioris centuriae,' or ‘ decumus hastatus posterior 3 ’
ζ and the highest, the commander of the maniple of ‘pilani’ in the first
1 cohort, who would be fully styled ‘primae cohortis pilus,‚prior,’ or more

commonly ‘centurio primipilus' or ⁶ primopilus ⁸.' In passing through

’ all these gradations‚ the centurion changed his century at each successive

step ⁴, and in this highest position had custody of the legionary eagle‚
with large accompanying emoluments ὗς ranked next to the ‘tribuni; ' and
was admitted with thern to the council of the general ⁶. . The centurions
appear to have still appointed their subordinate officers ⁷, but to have
been themselves now directly appointed by Caesar, 9'ften as a personal
favour ⁸, and, apparently, without previous service ⁹.

Augustus had perpetuated the custom introduced by the ‘dictator
Caesar ¹⁰, of placing the whole legion under the command of a ‘legatus'
These ‘ legati legionum ¹¹ ' are senators of praetorian rank, or in a position
to expect such rank ¹², and, as has been seen, ranked also as provincial g
vicegerents under the ‘legatus Augusti ¹⁸! Ι

The position of the legionary ‘tribuni militum' now becomes some-
what anomalous ; inasmuch as they are no longer, as formerly, com-
manders in turn of the legion ¹⁴, and several of their other duties ¹⁵ must

» have been transferred to the ‘praefectus castrorum ¹⁶! Nor do they
,Ξ appear to have commanded the legionary cohorts‚ which, so far as they
’ had a separate command, were probably placed each under its first cen-
