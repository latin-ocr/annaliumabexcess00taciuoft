Ο 2. non modo. Nipp. here notes the
apparently inadvertent repetitions found
sometimes in Tacitus, as here ‘ modo ’ . . .

J ⁸ mod0,' also ‘ eximeretur ’ . . . ‘ exemit ' (3.
’, 18.1); ‘nisi’. . .‘nisi ' (3. 57, 2) z ‘simul’

‘simul' (4. 16, 1), etc. On the other
hand, the repetition here of ‘subtractis’
.. . ‘subtracta3’ as of ‘parentur' . . . ‘paren-
tur' (2. 33‚4); ‘venas ’ . . . ‘venas ² (6. 9,
4): are intentional. Many instances of

⁸ each kind are cited here by Nipp. from a

nauch larger list in Joh. Miiller (Beitr'age‚
sect. 4. 11-18).
ipsius orationibus. These would pro-

— bably be recorded in the ‘acta senatus;’

grew« ·

cite the ⁸ acta' themselves as evidence of

ζ the mode of procedure. See Introd. iii.

3. modo, etc. Although an inscription
· (Ι. R. N. 4762) records a person as ‘per
commendation(em) Ti. Caesaris Augusti

ab senatu co(n)s(ul) dest(inatus)‚’ this
passage appears clearly to show that his
control of these elections was insormal,
and not analogous to the special ¹ com·
mendatio’ of ‘ candidati Caesaris’ sor

other magistracies. See on c. μευ-2 ; and

Introd. vi. p. 80. Tacitus is here describ-
ing three modes of informal recommenda-
tion : (1) by giving two names to the
consuls, and stating that no others had
offered themselves; which amounts to a
‘ nominatio' (see on c. 14, 63 and Introd.
1.1.) of two candidates only: (2) and (3)
without even formal ‘ nominatio ς* by in-
dicating in a speech or letter (without
names) the persons whom he preferred ; or
by intimating to ‘candidati' that they
need not canvas, and leaving it apparently
to them to make this known.

subtractis, ‘ being suppressed: ’ cp.
‘aliis nominatis me unum subtrahebat’
(curt. 6. 10, 7).
