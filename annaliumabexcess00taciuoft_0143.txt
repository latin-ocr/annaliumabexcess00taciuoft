ἕ CHARACTER AND GOVERNMENT OF TIBERIUS. 125
ἓεεΙΙίης justice; and the later history of the man is admitted to have
shown that compassion was undeserved1. Nor will any regret the
punishment of informers for false or vexatious charges ². Three again
are acquitted ³, another saved by indefinite adj0urnment 4, another par-
doned amidst genuine applause ⁵, in another case the gravest part of
., the charge is allowed to drop ⁶, in another expulsion from the senate is
the only penalty ’1.
Granting however that the numerical list shrinks thus considerably on
· investigation, many cases will still remain showing an increased sensitive-
ness to libels and vindictiveness in punishing them. Charges of this

kind, if not, in the former case, actually entering into the indictment‚ help .

, to bring about the downfall of Silius⁸ and L. Piso⁹ ; it is for these that
s Votienus is condemned to exile ¹⁰, and that Cassius Severus, an old
‚2³ offender 11, has his punishment increasedffl. By a further stretch‚ the law
is made to reach Cremutius Cordus sor a work which, according to one
ἦ, account, was of old standing and had even been recited before Augustus ¹³,
‘gand for a mere passage in which the eulogy was awarded to Cassius
which had once been spoken over him by Brutus ¹⁴. We are assured
' that the whole circumstances of the trial left the accused no prospect of
⁵ escaping condemnation but by suicide.
’ Sometimes again conviction is allffged to have been enforced where
³ proof was wanting; as in the trial of old Serenus on charges of con-
,ἦ spiracy preferred by his son3 charges which were certainly dismissed as
absurd in respect to some of the persons implicated in them, and on
{which the evidence is stated to have altogether broken down¹⁵. Yet
s Caesar is represented as insisting upon a condemnatory vote, though
jss?interposing to modify the proposed penalty of death or strieter banish-
{g ment ¹⁶, satisfied apparently with the conviction itself.
, ’ Lastly, at the close of this period, in the case of Titius Sabinus we are
Tinformed of disgraceful expedients to procure ev1dence ¹⁷ of a hurried
‘vote and immediate execution without trial, on the very opening festival
ἲ- of the new year, in obedience to a missive from the prince ¹⁸. There may
{sshave been more in the case thanis reported¹⁹, but the ominous beginning)
ἑοῖ the terrible letters from Capreae must be noted here.
Informers again appear to be more openly encouraged‚ protected from
sq· t retribution' in case of falsehood²⁰‚ and secured of their reward, even
