sepulchrum. a cenotaph. The place
would be in the sorum ofAutioch (c. 7 3, 5).

1. tribunal. 1t has been thought that
this would commemorate his imperium
(Wahher), or provincial jurisdiction (cp.
c. 57, 4). Nipp. thinks it took the form
of a scaffold or bier, to represent that on
which the body was laid out; such a
memorial tribunal, erected by one who
appears to have held no such ⁶ imperium,’
being recorded in an inscription (Orelli
4548). NVords relating to th ese memorials
appeartraceable in the inscription (Fragm.
a. 17-1 ).

Epidaphnae. This famous grove
and sanctuary of Apollo, described by
Gibbon (c. 23), was really called Δάφνη,
and gave to this Antioch its distinguish-
ing title, ἐπὶ Δάφνῃ, or ‘Antiochia Epi-
daphnes’ (Pl. N. H. 5. 21, 18, 79). It
was really five· miles from Antioch‚ but
considered a suburb of it.

2. coleretur. Halm and Nipp. adhere
to this old correction, on the ground that
the MS. ‘colerentur’ would appear to
imply that the places where statues were
honoured might be other than those in
which they stood. The ‘cultus' would
probably be that of his ⁵ Dii Manes’ (see
note on c. 7, 3).

numerum inierit, ‘ could enumerate: ’
cp. 15. 41, 1. The phrase is so used by
Caes. and Liv.

3. clipeus, ‘a medallion bust.’ Pliny
(N. H. 35. 3, 3, 12) says that such had
been set up at Rome from the consulship
of Appius Claudius in 2 59, Β. c. 495. An
‘imago clipeata' of Cicero, not appar-
ently in bronze, but marble, is engraved
in Visconti, Ic. Rom. pl. xii. Orelli refers
also to other specimens.

4. inter auctores eloquentiae. These
medallions of great orators appear to
have been set up in thePalatine library t cp.
c. 37, 3. Germanicus is recorded to have
pleaded causes from a date before the
exile of Ovid (Fasti 1, 21), until aster his
triumph (Suet. Cal. 3); and the above
authors, as well as Pliny (N. H. 8. 42, 64,

155), speak of him also as a poet ; but
the authorship of the translation of Aratus
and other remains ascribed to him is
matter of question.

solitum paremque, ‘ of the usual
material’ (bronze) ‘ and size;' as opposed
to one ‘ auro et magnitudine insignis.‘

fortuna: cp. c. 71, 6.

7. cuneum. The military sense of
this word (1. 51, 1) is not applicable to
‘ equites : ' we must therefore suppose one
of the wedge-shaped divisions of the
‘ quatuordecim ordines' in the theatre to
be here meant (cp. Suet. Dom. 4). These
fourteen rows were apparently divided
into cunei ‘seniorum’ and ‘iuniorum '
(Marquardt‚ Hist. Eq. Rom. p. 71). This
honour was paid to Germanicus as having
been ‘princeps iuventutis’ (Ov. ex P. 2.
5, 41); on which title, see 1. 3, '2, etc.

8. turmae. The centuries of ‘equites
Romani equo publico ’ (on whom see
Introd. vii. p. 87 ; Mommsen, Staatsr. ii.
p. 381, foll. ; Seeley, Hist. Exam. of Livy,
B. 1. p. 73, 79 soll.) appear to have been
arranged at their ‘ transvectio ’ (see below)
into six ‘turmae ' each commanded by a
⁶ sevir: ’ see Insc. Orell. 304 3 ; I-Ienzen 641 2.

Dionys. Hal. (6. 13, 1069) describes them Δΐ
as riding in a procession of about 5000, ¹
dressed in the ‘trabea ' and crowned'with ξς
olive, in commemoration of the sup- . ,ξ
posed appearance of the Dioscuri at the- ξ
battle of lake Regillus. The institution-¹ ‚

is said to date from 450, Β. c. 304 (Liv. 9.

46, 15), and to have been revived by Au·

gustus after long disuse (Suet. Aug. 38).

again would be in recognition of his
having led the procession as ‘princeps
