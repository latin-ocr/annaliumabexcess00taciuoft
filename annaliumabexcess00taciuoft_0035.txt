TACJTUS’ SOURCES oF INFORMATION. 17

and personal details over that which is more strictly historica! matter.
Dio, while omitting much that Tacitus mentions, as would be natural
in a work covering the whole of Roman history, and having to con-
dense throughout, yet, on the other hand, inserts many particulars
omitted by Tacitus, and often adopts a different scale of historic-al
proportion1. Such a writer would necessarily have to be content with
less research than the historian of a special period, and it is thus natural
to suppose that he chiefly drew from a few of the best-known writers
of each time, and that the liveliness of detail, the comparison or sugges-
tion 'of alternative views, and other characteristics of the narrative of
Tacitus, argue a more comprehensive survey of the various contemporary
sources of history open to him.

Much‚ however, of this abundant material must have been untrust»
worthy. The first fundamental defect to notice is that which has been
prominently put forward by Dio, at the transition point in his narrative ᾗ
He, with all the materials before him which we have, and much more
which we have not, finds himself, at the establishment of the principate‚
passing from daylight into comparative darkness, deepening, no doubt,
ᾗ towards his own time, as publicity was more and more-‘'suppressed.
Ῐ In former days, public affairs were discussed before senate and people,

by persons of every shade of opinion ; now the forum was silenced‚ even
the minutes of the senate no longer public, and the vast departments
centered in the princeps received their'intelligence and transacted their
business in private, and communicated no more than they thought fit.
What was divulged could not be tested, and those who disbelieved the.
information' had only surmise to substitute for* it. Sometimes, no doubt,
light was afterwards thrown on a dark place, through the record of their
, own transactions by public rnen ³, or authentic private communications
which found their way into history, and exposed the falsifications of an
v ' imperial bureau. bTacitus, for instance, or his informants, seem to have
3 had means of knowing that the official report of Tiberius on the Gallie
revolt was no more nor less than truth 4; and that, on the other hand, he
ᾗ, had concealed the extent of the losses inflieted by the Frisii. ⁵ It must be
