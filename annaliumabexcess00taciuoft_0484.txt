dignatio sacerdotum atque ipsis promptior animus foret ad capes-

cated from which the objection to the
loss of ‘patria potestas' over ⁶ flamen‘
and ‘flaminica’ proceeded, whether from
possible candidates or their parents. The
passage in Livy (27. 8) would show the
office to have been rather a burden than
a privilege, as a person is ‘ taken’ sor it
against his will.

1. qui. . . apisceretur. Gaius (1, 130)
says, ‘exeunt liberi virilis sexus de patris
potestate, si flamines Diales inaugurentur,
et feminini sexus, si virgines Vestales
capiantur.’ This was without ‘capitis
diminutio,' such as would have been in-
volved in adoption into another family.
The ceremony of ‘taking’ was a kind of
‘mancipatio‚’ by which the person came
under the ‘ potestas' of the deity, repre-
sented by the chief pontifs: see Mar-
quardt‚ Staatsv. iii. p. 301.

flamonium: so also in 13 2, 6.
Mommsen (Ep h Epig. i. 222) notes that
the office of flamen is always in inscrip-
tions ‘flaminatusf or ‘flamonium,' and
that the latter form is preserved by the
MSS. of Tacitus, ofCic. (Phil. 13. 19 41),
and of Livy (26. 23).

quaeque . . . . conveniret. ‘Con
ventio in manum,' whereby the husband
acquired a power analogous to that of a
father over his wife, though not essential
to marriage as such. was involved in the
ceremony of ‘confarreatio' or ‘coemptio,’
or the fact of a year's unbroken ‘ usus.’
A marriage of the latter kind would thus
always be ‘ sine conventione' during the
first year, and5 even by old law, might
thus continue indefinitely, by annual sus-
pension of cohabitation for a ‘ trinoctium.'
In this and other ways marriages ‘ sine
conventione’ had come to be the rule; the
woman thus becoming ‘uxor tantummodo‚’
not ‘mater familias’ (CioTop. 3, 14). By
the old law she gained thereby no freedom,
but remained in ‘potestate patris;’ lat-
terly, however, the ‘patria potestas’ had
become much relaxed, and women were
enabled, by legal fictions, ⁴tt> control their

own property througha‘ procurator,' and
acquire practical independence (see Mar·
quardt, Privatl i. p63). To this the
marriage of the flaminica’ would be an ἶ
exception, being necessarily by‘ con· ‘²
sarreatioss and therefore cum comen-1
tione.’

2. senatus decreto aut lege. Nipp. ,’
notes that ‘leges' still continue to be ⁴
distinctly mentioned (cp. 11. 13, 23 H. 3.
37, 3; 4. 47, 2), and that several distinct 3
‘ leges' of this and later date are specified g
by jurists, but that their enactment by ἶ

formality. It probably corresponded toi*
the formal ‘renuntiatio’ of elections, οῖ’
