2 INTRODUCTION.

On the other hand, Pliny, who must have been born in 814 or 815,
A.D. 61 or 62 ¹, speaks of Tacitus and himself as ‘aetate propemodum
aequales3' adding, however, that the oratorieal reputation of his friend
was already established when his own professional career began2. It
appears to follow, that the birth of Tacitus, while it cannot be placed
later than &ww can hardly have taken place earlier than 805,
A·¹2·..5-²· In othe ds, he must have been born ir? of the last

years of Claudius, or in the first of Nero. s
His parentage and family are unknown. We can assume the nobility

of no ‘Cornelius‚' as such, since the ex nsion of that name to the
10,000 freedmen of Sulla³; and the cognomen is one of those which
appear to indicate a servile origin ⁴. Even if this be so, most of the
equestrian, and many even of the senatorial, families in this age could

l

claim no higher origin⁵; and although the Cornelii Taciti are unknown -

in the Fasti, one of them at least had reached the ‘equestris nobilitas '
of a procuratorship in the time of the elder Pliny⁶; and, as the name
is rare, may probably have been related to the historian. It is again
to be inferred that he belonged to a family of some consideration, from

h'ls admission to the quaestorship and senate, at the earliest, or almost*

the earliest, legal age.

His praenomen is uncertain. Throughout the letters of Pliny, in
the allusions of Tertullian, Vopiscus, Jerome, and Orosius, and in the
second Medicean MS, he has no fuller name than ‘Cornelius Tacitus.

- On the other hand, the praenomen ‘ Gaius’ is given to him by Sidonius

Apollinaris, a scholar of the middle of the fifth century ⁷, and that of
‘Publius' in the first Medicean MS.
Assuming the genuineness of the Dialogue ‘ de Oratoribus,’ we may

suppose him to describe in it the studies of his boyhood, and their ἧ

defeets ⁸, corrected' in his own case by an ardent study of t'he great
classica] models of Roman eloquence, particularly Cicero. He lays
the scene of this Dialogue in 827, A.D. 74 ⁹, when he would be
from twenty to twenty-two years of age; and represents himself in it
as even then on terms of friendship with the leaders of the Roman
bar ¹⁰. ⁴
