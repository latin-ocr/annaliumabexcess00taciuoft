million H. S., which, besides two ⁴ patri-
monia ' and other inheritances, had been
spent on the public service. Directions
and provision were made for prompt

yment, but some delay- ensued (Suet.
g'aib. 573 Dio, 57. 14, 1).

1. civilem, that of au ordinary citi·

populo et plebi. Suet. states
these bequests thus, ‘populo R. quad-
ringenties tribubus tricies quinquies ses·

. tertium: This has been generally taken

to mean that the former sum was to be
paid into the ⁴ aeraxium’ (cp. this special
use of ‘populus’ 6. 17, 43 also ‘pecunia

We have a similar payment to the treasury,
coupled with a distribution, in ¹3- 31, 2.
But it is hardly likely that the ‘plebs’
were equally distributed over the rustic as
well as urban tribes ; and the whole thirty-
five tribes, while on the one hand extend·
ing all over Italy, on the other, excluded
much os the ‘ plebs urbana ' (see Introd.
vii. p. 89); while the total sum would

‘populo et plebi,’ must have been dis·

such ns in c. 72, ²3 78. 2, etc.. would
make ‘plebi' mere surplusage. The
possible solution may be that neither
Tacitus nor Suetonius has quoted accu-
rately; the real words having been such
as to give the whole sum to the ‘ plebs

Halm, after Sauppe, from the statement

cohortibus civium R. On these
cohorts see Introd. vii. p. 106. They are
omitted by Suet. The expression of Dio
(πολιτικῷ πλήθει) would include them.
Nipp. substitutes ‘ac ’ sor ‘aut,' which
might however have the force of ‘ et
vicissim‚’ as in 2. 47, 4, etc.

5. ex quis qui maxime insignes visi.
It has been generally felt that this passage
can hardly be sound as it stands in the MS. ;
but Nipp.'s correction, the omission of
‘ visi,’ is met by the difficulty of account-
ing for the presence of the word. The
suggestion os Bezzenberger, that, ‘qui’
may have dropped out aster ⁶ quis,' is free
from objection, and allows a demonstra-
tive to be supplied from it as the object
of ‘censuere’ Even thus there is a eon·
fusion of constructions‚ through the at-
tempt to combine in one sentence the
proposals made and the names of the
proposers. A similar desire to condense
has produced the same effect elsewhere,
as in 2. 64, 4 ς· ipsorumque regum inge-
nia,’ etc.)‚ and 11. 29, 2 (‘dein metu‚' etc.).
For a full discussion of this passage, see
Joh. Miiller, Beitrage‚ sect. 3, pp. 1-5.

6. porta triumphali. This gate, prob-
ably closed except at triumphs, is sup-
posed to have stood between the ‘Porta
Flumentana ' and ‘ Carmentalis: The
question is discussed by Burn tp. 46) and
Dyer (D. of Geog. ‘ Roma,¹ p. 752).

fully c. 123 13.

8. addebat. On the habit ‘egrediendi '

deliberations were more strictly limited to
