1. rationes familiares: so ‘ pecuniaess
‘curae‚’ ‘angustiae samiliares' (4. 15, 33

11. 7, 3; 12. 52‚4).
3. commoto, ete. The capitalists had

’ all broken the law, and had to bring

their affairs into harmony with it in
eighteen months. All illeg al mans, in
other words, a large proportion of all

loans, were thus c

4. et quia. Another independent
cause of the scarcity of money is added.
The events of the last year had led to so
many condemnations and confiscations
for conspiracy or treason‚ that the treasu-
ries were gorged, and the money in
circulation proportionately diminished.

is given in Suet. Tib 48, ‘ut faeneratores

verent; ’which last words—Nipp. inserts

Tacitus may perhaps have considered
such a clause to be implied in what he

has stated. Such a decree, besides being,
no doubt, based upon the ‘lex' itsel
(see c. 16, 1), would also be intended t
increase the demand for land, to th
advantage of debtors who had estate
to sell; and to remedy the scareity o
money, partly through lands being taken
over in lieu of cash, partly by the sup—
position that the remaining one· -third of
capital would be left at interest undis-

   
   

the senate did not preclude the ordina

right of a creditor to call in his debts as
and when he pleased. This they exer-
cised by calling in, not only two-thirds,

but all debts at once in fu113 and it was

obliga on ο the capitalist, to bn‘ng his
affairs into conformity with the law,g had
eighteen months to run. They could
thus force the debtor to realise at once,
with all the disadvantages of scarcity ol*
money, and of flooding the market with
estates and property for sale; and could
themselves bide their time for bargains,
to purchase land at leisure' m accordance
with the law or decree.

8. concursatio, etc.; first men ran
from one nioney lender to another- with
entreaties for money or time; then the
praetor's court rang with notices of suits
for debt.

10. omnem . . . condiderant. *⁴ Con-
diderant' is equivalent to ‘conditam ser-
vabant : ’ as they got in their money, they
reserved it for bargains in land.

11. copiam vendendi, etc. With the
gerund,‘ eopia ’generally means ‘oppor-
tunityf as ‘mutuandi copia below: here
it appears to mean ‘'abundance of sales3

as, with simple gen.‚ in 3. 63, 2· ‚ 4. 69,
