fioetions and the mode of selection for this
office are given fully in Gell. 1. 12, where
it is shown that ‘ capere ’ (cp. Ann. 4. 16,
6; 15. 22, 4), is strictly used ; as the
pontifex maximus took her by the hand
from her father, as if captive in war, with
the words ¹ te, Amata, capio,' whereby she
passed out of the ‘ potestas patria.' The

Δ law had prescribed a ‘sortitio ’ out of

twenty candidates selected by the comitia,
but this custom seems to have been already
departed from, and, when Gellius wrote,
was held to be unnecessary3 the practice
being for persons to offer their daughters,
as here mentioned.

Occius Flamma, procos. of Crete at about

neptem et quinquaginta. They were
chosen at from six to ten years old
(Gen. 1.1.), and were legally bound for
thirty years; after which time they might
retire and marry, but usually continued in
office for lise; see Marquardt, iii. p. 326.

2. praesederat. Any Vestal might be
said ‘praesidere Vestalibus sacris: ' the
head of the college was the eldest virgin
(cp. 11. 32, 53 Ov. Fast. 4, 639), the
'virgo Vestalis maxima ’ of inscriptions.

β. saevitiam annonae. Drager notes
ssus as a novel metaphor‚ analogous to
‘laevitia hiemis,‘ ‘mai-is,’ etc. Tacitus
'hs also ‘gravitas annonae' (6. 13, 1),

‘acris annona ' (4. 6, 6).

plaints found utterance at the theatre and

other public gatherings.

statuit pretium, i.e. it was to be
sold at less than the current price, and
the difference made up out of the ‘ fiscus!
This has nothing to do with the usual
monthly com-dole, but corresponds rather
to the occasional ‘frumentationes‚' such
as are mentioned in Mon. Anc. iii. 10, 40;
Suet. Aug. 41, etc.: cp. 15. 39, 2 ‘pre-
tium frumenti minutum usque ad ternos
nummos.' On the regulation of the cori]-
market at Rome by the government, see

increpuit. Suetonius (Tib. 27) speaks
with more detail: ‘Dominus appellatus
a quodam, denuntiavit ne se amplius
contumeliae causa nominaret. Alium
dicentem sacras eius occupationes et rur—
sus alium, auctore eo senatum se adisse,
verba mutare et pro auctore suasorem,
pro sacris laboriosas dicere coegit' (cp.
the speech in 4, 38). He considered
that he could properly be addressed as
‘dominus' only by his slaves (see his
saying quoted in Introd. vi. p. 66, note
1) : and, though the example set by him
and Augustus (Suet. Aug. 53) gradually
found exceptions (among which may be
noted the regular use of ‘ domine ’ as the
address of Pliny to Trajan), the title does
not become established as that of the
princeps till the time of Diocletian. See
Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p. 7393 and a
complete history of the use of the term
