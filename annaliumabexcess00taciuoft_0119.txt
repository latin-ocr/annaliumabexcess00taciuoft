cisms ¹, and the motley crowd of Alexandria, almost rivalling that of
’ , Antioch ’ς and Moesia and Pannonia, where Dacian hordes were already

 

beginning to be heard of on the Danube³; must have been the chief
objects of solicitude to Caesar.

The amount of provincial revenue was probably not reduced, but the
mode of assessment reorganized⁴3 and, in general terms, it is admitted
even by Tacitus, that the provinces were better off under the principate}
than under the Republic⁵ , and were treated with marked justice andi
moderatiori during at least the early years of Tiberius ⁶· ς and that the ἰ

”fid-*-

Canan provinces were so far more economically governed than the ί

senatorial, that a change from one to the other was a virtual abatementss

⁷ of tribute. ⁷ In both classes of provinces, extortion was severely checked ⁸ ¹¹
⁷ instead of being criminally connived at; and governors were warned to

shear, not flay, their sheep ⁹, whose prosperity had become the common
ξ interest of ruled and ruler.

overlook the still existing evils ¹⁰. Conviction of the guilty did not
necessarily imply restitution to the pillaged 11; and the punishment
must have been ostenffnadequate ¹², and have failed to deter others.
² Im the last years of Augustus, the atrocities of Volesus Meffilla inp
Asia¹⁸ were such as could hardly have been exceeded under the Re
public: in the same province, within the next ten years, another pro-
consul ¹⁴ and a procurator ¹⁵ are convicted of extorti0n; and proconsuls
of two other provinces ¹⁶ are condemned on equally serious charges:
nor, does Silius come with cleaner hands from Germany ¹⁷: in Spain
a legatus is assassinated through some money grievance‚ of which we
have only the Roman version ¹⁶: the Frisii are goaded into rebellion
