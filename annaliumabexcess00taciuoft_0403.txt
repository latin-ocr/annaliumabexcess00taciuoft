is said ⁸ iura dare,’ in Liv. 1. 8, Ι1 ; and to
do sois osten spoken of by Vergil (e. g.
Aen. 1. 2933 3, 137; 5, 758) as a kingly
function. It is perhaps here implied that
Augustus enacted these laws, without se-
nate or comitia, by some survival of his
ppwer ‘reipublicae constituendae: See

ommsen‚ Staatsr. i. p. 723.

(queis) paee et principe uteremur.
The simplest explanation of these words
would be to take ‘queis' as an instru-
mental abl„ and ‘pace et principe' as
depending on ‘uteremun’ Against this
Ξῗιῖεἲέἓὲξίῗ ἷῖἒὶ ἷξὶᾆέἷθῗέαψὲῂὲῗῗῖὲᾶ
gibus uti ' is a known phrase (e.g. Lucr.
5, 1143). This would favour the inter-
pretation of Nipp. and others, by which
‘queis' depends on ‘ uteremur’ and ‘ pace
et principe’ is an abl. abs„ ‘for us to
enjoy in peace and under a prinee! Such
a construction, though usual for ‘ pace,’

ἶ is certainly harsh for ‘principe ; ' but this
ζ word, on either interpretation, is to be
. taken as thrown in bitterly and παρὰ προσ-

zozimam-iou ex eo vinela, ‘thencefor-
ward restraints were stricter.’ Allusion
is probably intended generally to the

¹ stretch of arbitrary power (c-p. ἐκ τούτου

μυναρχεῖσθαι αὖθις ἀκριβῶς ἤρξαντο Dio,

1 52. 1, 1), and specially to the ‘lex Iulia
¹, de maritandis ordinibus' and any similar

euactments before it, or to any edicts or
‘senatus consulta’ interfering with pri-

= vate life.

inditi custodes, ‘ watch was set over
πει· cp. ‘castella rupibus indita’ 4. 46,
53 and ‘additus’ in 4. 67, 6; 6.14, 3,
ete. The delators are called ‘custodes
legum’ by Tiberius (4. 30, 4); and we
Δ ffler that they were already active be-
' the ‘ lex Papia Poppaea ’ assigned defi-

· nite rewards to them.

⁷ ²· praemiis. Their amount may be
utimated from the fact that Nero reduced

them to one fourth (Suet. Ner. 10); which
appears to have been the informer's mini-
mum under the law of ‘ maiestas ' (cp. 4.
²0, 3)-

ut . . . teneret, ‘ in order that, if men
neglected to earn the rewards of pater-
nity‚ the state as the common parent
might possess the unowned properties : '
¹ vacantia ' does not refer to ‘privilegia,'
but to some such word as ‘bona.' On
these penalties and forfeitures‚ see the
Excursus at the end of this Book.

4. altius penetrabant: cp. 2. 36, 2.
Here it appears to mean that they forced.
their way further into private life than the
law had contemplated, laying information
(cp. ‘corripio’ c. 49, 13 2. 28, 4, etc.),
against all citizens (to whom alone the
law applied) throughout the empire.

5. multorum . . . excisi status,
‘many had their position undermined!
For instance, in some cases the possession
of a senatorial or equestrian census, in
others the ‘status’ of a freedman, etc„
might depend on bequests that could be
invalidated. Cp. H. 1. 10, 2 ‘attritis
opibus, lubrico statu,’ and the similar
language above (c. 26, 2) ‘cum omnis
domus . . . subverteretur3’ also Plin. Pan.
48 ‘nulla iarn testamenta secura, nullius
status certus!

8. exsoluti . . . nexus. Orelli notes
other similar metaphors: cp. ‘ vinclis ex-
solutis’ (c. 33, 4); and ‘enodandos . . .
iuris laqueos’ (Gell. 13. 10, 1); ‘qui
iuris nodos et legum aenigmata solvat’
(Juv. 8, 50) ; ‘iurisdictionis retia et . . .
nodos resolventes' (Cod. 4. 29, 23, pn).
W alther and Mr. Dallin take ‘nexus ⁹ in
the strict legal sense (=‘ obligations ’);
but these commissionem appear not so
much to have released men from any ob-
ligations contracted‚ as to have ‘loosed
many snares’ woven out of the law by
the subtlety of informers: deelaring such
cases not to come within its intention.
