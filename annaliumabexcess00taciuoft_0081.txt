NOTE. —Tloe material os this portion is almost wholly derived from Mommsen’s
·R6misches Staatsrechtss vol. ii. part 23 partly also from his commentary on the

· Marmor Ancyranum.’

Tm: constitution of the principate is dated most properly from the
acts of Jan. 13, 727, B.c. 27, and from enactments in the preceding
year; but account must be taken both of powers held by the first
‘princeps' before that date, and of those which he subsequently acquired.

Gaius Caesar Octavianus, in his nineteenth year, had raised forces on
his own authority¹ ; and his position was legalised by a decree of the
senate of Jan. 17, 711, 13.c. 43, by which he acquired the rank of pro—
praetor, with a military imperium² which during the rest of his long

’ life never left him; so that his ‘dies accepti imperii’ is either reckoned
from this, or from the consulship, which on the 19th of August in the
same year followed it ³.

His permanent imperium, however, during these years comes through
the irregular and mainly usurped powers of the triumvirate; a plebiscite
having been hurried through the comitia in November of the same year
by the tribune P. Qtius, creating ‘triumviri reipublicae constituendae:

· with consular power, for five years⁴; at the end of which they assumed

f another five years of power by their own act, without any formal vote ⁵.

At some early date during this period Caesar had assumed a title

² of 'permanent importance‚ the ‘praenomen imperatoris ⁶.' Suetonius

ἶ ascribes this praenomen to the dictator⁷3 who, however, appears from .

Ξ inscriptions to have borne the title immediately after his family name,

ἰ before his titles of office. ⁸ It is suggested that the title, in this position,
became a kind of additional cognomen, such as his heir might adopt;

and that, in usage, he might be styled indifferently ‘ Caesar Imperator' 2

ς οι· ‘Imperator Caesar: as men might speak of ‘ Aemilius Paullus' or

‚r ‘Paullus Aemilius ⁹.' However this may be, this praenomen is hence-
