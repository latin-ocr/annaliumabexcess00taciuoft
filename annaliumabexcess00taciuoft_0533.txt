1. M. Licinio L. Calpurnio. From

Ἴ two inscriptions (Orell. 156, 3056) the
“ full names, M. Licinius Crassus Frugi,
, - and L. Calpurnius Piso, can be supplied.
’- ⁴ The latter is supposed to be the Cn. Piso
i who had to take a new praenomen (see

3. 17, 8). The former also bears a cog-

, nomen of the ‘Pisones,' andis shown by

this to mean ‘frequentiorem redderet, '
supposing that the structure was made
slight so as to be larger in proportion to

simple meaning of‘ edere’ in 11. 22, 3,
