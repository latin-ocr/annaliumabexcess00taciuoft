. Staatsrecht' (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1876, 1877), and of his
‘ Res gestae Divi Augusti,’ or edition of and commentary
on the ‘ Monumentum Ancyranum’ (Berlin, 1865), also of
Marquardt's ‘ Romische Staatsverwaltung' (Leipzig, 1 8 7 3—
1878), Friedlaender's ‘ Darstellungen aus der Sitten-
geschichte Roms' (5th ed., Leipzig, 1881), and Dean
Merivale's ‘History of the Romans under the Empire.’
Various obligations to several other works‚ which have
been consulted for more special purposes, will be found
mentioned in their places ¹.

I have also gratefully to acknowledge assistance de-
rived from the following unpublished sources.

Mr. T. F. Dallin, M.A.‚ late Public Orator in the
University of Oxford‚ and· formerly Fellow and Tutor
of Queen’s ColIege, had originally undertaken an edition
of this portion of the Annals for the Delegates of the
University Press; and, after his death, the materials
collected by him were entrusted to me to make such use
of as I thought fit. From them has been taken the
chief part of the Excursus on the ‘Lex Papia Poppaea 2,'
as also several notes or parts of notes, especially on
some of the early chapters of Book III, which are duly
acknowledged where they occur. Ι feel sure that all
will join in regretting that, owing to his untimely death,
and to the pressure of other important occupations
during the years immediately preceding it, the acquire-
ments.of so ripe a scholar were prevented from being
made far more largely available to the student of Tacitus.

Most kind and valuable assistance has also been
rendered to me by the Venerable Archdeacon Edwin
Palmer, D.D.‚ one of the Delegates of the University
Press, not only in the shape of numerous suggestions
tending to amend the substance and form of a con-
siderable portion of the Introduction and notes examined '
