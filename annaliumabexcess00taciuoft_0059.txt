THE SFNTAX AND STVLE OF TACITUS. 41

33. Objeetive Genii-,ive (Roby 1312).

     
  
 

(a) The geant'ves mei, sui, etc„ are used sreely sor the possessive pronaum
without the usual restriction lo cases (gf special emphasis (Madv. 297 b,
Obs. 2), as nostri origine 2. 54, 3; sui incessu 4. 24, 2, etc. In this
usage Tacitus is surpassed perhaps only by Apuleius. Dr. ξ 68 a.

j (b) With verbs, such a genitive is used, by Tacitus alone, with monere 1.
. 67, 1 (as in classical prose with its compounds) ; with adipisci 3. 55, 1 ;
Ἴ and apisci 6. 45, 6 (on the analogy of potiri). The use with egere (4. 20,
ff ' 4, etc.) and indigere (6. 46, 9, etc.) is more common. Dr. ξ 68 b.

; (c) The ellz‘plical genitive, so constant with verbs of judging or accusing,
, ιίς· extended by Tacitus to some new examples‚ as postulare 1. 74, 1, etc. ;
Ξ deferre 4. 42, 3, etc. ; urgere (ἅπ. εἷρ.) 6. 29, 3. Dr. ξ 69.

ι (d) With participles, This usage is more common in Tacitus than in
any of his predecessors, though perhaps no participle is first so used by
him. A list of thirteen is given by Dr. (ξ 70), many of which occur

γ frequently, as cupiens 1. 75, 4, etc.; inpatiens 2. 64, 4, etc.; intolerans
1. 31, 4, etc. ; retinens 2. 38, 9, etc. ; sciens 1. 64, 6, etc. 3 and others.

(e) With adjectives, also characteristic of Tacitus from its extreme
frequency. Dr. § 71, Zumpt 437.

(ιι) Expressing direct object, like the participles above (d), where
a participle with accus. might be substituted (Roby 131 2): as with formi-
dolosior 1. 62, 3 ς pavidus 4. 38, 13 praescius 6. 21, 5; providus, 4.
38, 1, etc. “

(β) Expressing a remoter object, where the abl. with prep. would
be usual (Roby 1318): so ambiguus imperandi 1. 7, 4; exitii certus 1.
27, 3 ; incerta ultionis 2. 75, 1 3 potentiae securus 3. 28, 3 3 and many
others.

‚ (γ) Expressing the thing in point ofwhich a term is applied to
⁷ a person, an especial' lg poetical andTacitegn usage (Roby 1320). A very
’ξ frequent example is the (perhaps) locative animi (Roby 1168), as 1. 32, 5 ;
5 69, 2, etc. (often also in Verg. and Liv.); also the genitives with mani-
² festus 2. 85, 3, etc.; melior 3. 74, 1 3 modicus 2. 73, 3 ; occultus 4. 7, 2;
pervicax· 4. 53, 1 ; praeclarus 4. 34, 4; praestantissimus 6. 6, 2; sper-
] nendus 14. 40, 3 ; validus, 4. 21, 53 vetus 1. 20, 2 3 and others. Some-
times two genitives are concisely used where accusatives with inter would
- be expected, as with ambiguus 2. 24, 6 3 40, 2 ; and trepidus 6. 21, 4.

    
   

34. 'I'he genitive of quality is used with the same brachylogy as the
corresponding abl. (ξ 29); so Lentulus' senectutis extremae 4. 29, 1; Α
, velut eluctantium verborum 4. 31, 43 effusae clementiae 6. 30, 3;
