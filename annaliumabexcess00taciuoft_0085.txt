 

CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLV PRINCIPA ΤΕ. 67

Δ), five years only, such censorial power as belonged to the ‘ regimen legum

et morum¹.' It is also stated by Dio that he received at the same time
for life the consular power, with its insignia, the regular attendance of
twelve lictors, and a curule chair between those of the consuls of the year².
This is treated by Mommsen as an error, except so far as relates to the
mere assumption of the insignia ³. Augustus himself mentions two facts

“ only that bear upon the point. FiLs-tly, that in 7 32, Β. c. 22, he refused

the dictatorship, and also both the annual and perpetual consulship ¹.
Secondly, that twice in the latter part of his life he held a census with
‘ consulare imperium ’ζ’ censorial power being, in the theory of the consti—
tution, inherent in the consular, before the existence of the censorship as
a separate office. It is inferred‚ both from what he says and from what

’ he appears to imply, that this ‘consulare imperium' was used for this

purpose only, and that no general or permanent consular power was ever
assumed ⁶. It is obvious that a ruler holding a ‘ proconsulare imperium’
valid within the pomoerium ⁷ had already what was most important in the
consular power, and Augustus showed no desire for the accumulation of
empty titles. It would seem, however, possible that the decree which
Dio appears to quote may have given something more than mere con-
sular insignia. The conception of the princeps as the chief magistrate
of the state, implied in many powers exercised by Augustus and his
successors, might not impossibly have been represented by a consular
power or certain specified powers under that name; the more so, as such
power might be conceived by a fiction as comprehending functions of
other magistracies, as those of censor, praetor, or curule aedile, originally
included in the consulship. Some of these powers of the princeps are
specified below⁸; to which may be added that of ‘ nominating ' candidates
sor magistracies ⁹, which appears in some sort to assume that the princeps
was imagined as personally holding the comitia, which (in the case of
electioris to the greater magistracies) would be a consular function ¹⁰.
During the remainder of this principate the chief points to notice are
