3. adsidens. The accus. with this
verb (asin 6. 43, 1) appears to be chiefly
poetical (Verg. Ae'n. 11, 304; Val. Fl‚;
Sil.;) but is also found in Sall H. 4. 42D,
1 K, 44 G; (see note on 3 34, 2.) Stress
is laid on 'his frequent proximity to the
city as making the fulfilment of the
genuine prediction more remarkable, and
on his attainment os extreme old age, as
signally falsisying the impostor's infer-
enee.

strength from having been so near its sul·
