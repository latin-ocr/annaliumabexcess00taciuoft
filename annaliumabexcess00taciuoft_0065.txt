THE SVNTAX ΛΝΒ STVLE OF TACJTUS. 47

indignum erat 1. 42, 5 (where see Nipp.). Roby 1535 c, Madv. 348 e.
Here the protasis always precedes, except in H. 4. 19, 4.

(c) In the plupersect. Either to express a state of things which had
already existed sor some time, and would have continued to exist3 or,
in a vein of rhetorical exaggeration, as if what would have happened,
had happened3 as impleverat 4. 9, 15 contremuerant 6. 9, 63 oppressa
6. 43, 1; exstimulaverant 15. 50, 6. Also, without any expressed pro-
'tasis, to express what is no longer possible, as malueram 15. 2, 3.

C. SUBJUNCTIVE OR Conjunc‘nvn.

51. 'I'he Hypothetieal subjunctive, with condition not formelly
‚api-ossea, or Potential subjunctive (Madv, 350, Roby 1534, foll.)‚
as well as some forms of the optative or jussive subjunct. (Zumpt 529,
Roby 1584, solt), are used with characteristic sreedom in various tenses,
and with various meanings.

(a) Present, as mereare . . . recipias 1. 28, 7, etc.
(b) Imperfecl, as discerneres 3. 1, 53 requireres 13. 3, 6, etc.

i (c) Aorz'stz'c perfect, very frequently, in modest assertions, and in nega·

i tions of possibility, as with suffecerint 3. 50, 1; abnuerit 4. 3, 3; adpu-
lerit 4. 67, 2, etc.; in expressions of prohibition even with the third
person, as nemo . . . contenderit 4. 32, 1. See a full list in Dr. ξ 28, who
notes the rare use of this tense in such dependent sentences as ut sic
dixerim 14. 53, 43 ne . . . abierim 6. 22, 6 (where see note).

 

(d) With these may be mentioned the use qs this mood wilh quamquam,

frequent in Tacitus (e. g. 1. 3, 53 24, 43 3. 55, 4 ; 4. 67, 1, etc.), as in
-other post-Ciceronian prose 'and in poetry. Dr. § 201, Roby 1697.

52. 'Phe subjunctive of cases frequently ocem-ring, very rarely
ς found in Cicero, Caesar, or Sallust, but oftener in Livy, etc„ becomes
{more common in and after Tacitus (see Dr. ξ 159, 165, MadV. 359,
ἓϊΒοδγ 1716): with cum, as 1. 7, 83 2. 48, 23 qui 6. 8, 43 quo 4. 70, 3;
{quoquo 3. 74, 3, quoties 2. 2, 5, etc.; seu 4. 60, 3, etc.; ubi 1. 44, 8;
ᾗ, ut quis 1. 27, 1, etc.; and many others. See Dr. 1. l. and § 192, Nipp.

{itum apparently peculiar to Tacitus, and found only in 6. 19, 5 3 21, 43
