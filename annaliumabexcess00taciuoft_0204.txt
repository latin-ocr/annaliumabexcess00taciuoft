sufficiently forcible. Walther would take

legion as distinct from its officers. cp.
it to mean δή (‘ even associate with them-

‘ manipularis. dein centurio ’ (c. 20, 2).
2. probra in legatum cumulant.

This construction ‘cumulare aliquid in
aliquem' is almost confined to Tacitus :
53111531'212' ‚⁵.’. ἐξ· 11? 2315.. ᾱῑῗὲἶῖωδ ¹²³⁵
3. nihil reliqui faciunt,
nothing undone.’ The phrase is used in
this sense in Caes. B. G. 2. 26, 53 Sall.
Cat. 11, 73 and Atticus (ap. Nep. 21, 5);
as also ‘nihil reliquum fieri' Sall. Jug.
76, 43 the expression being in all places
negative. On the genitive, see Introd. v.

5 ξιιὲιιιίιιιη. This word has here the

force of ‘ quin‚' as in several other
passages of Tacitus (5. 5, 2; 13. 14, 3,·
14. 39, 2, etc.), but, according to Drager,
in no other author.
I ,1ἐὴ permoffssffnt' ‘dtir 'to their depths.’
n e use 0 is wor wl
the feeling excited (as 3. 23, ι· , 16. 32,
2) Tacitus' is preceded only by Quintilian
(12. 10, 36). The impersth is adapted
to the really past soree of the historic
present: see Introd. v. ξ 48.

6. iam. This would most naturally

⁸ leave

be taken (as by Mr. F rost) ιιι the sense of
ἤδη = from this point,’ as ‘cetera iam
sabulosa’ (G. 46, 5); but it may be
doubted whether the word is thus made

cemos

selves’ ), and considers thatinH. ι. ι 5 8,
‘etiam' has similarly the force of καὶ δή.
7. plures seditioni duces. These
are distinguished from the ⁶ ministri ' pre·
viously abetting Percennius (c.17,1).
On the dative see Introd. v. 5 19.
9. quid pararet intentos, ‘watching

what he would do.’ No ottier ins auce *

is noted of such a construction, which is
due to the desire os brevity; ‘intentos’
being used for· intente observantes:

13. gladiatores. Provincialgovernors Μ
usually kept a troop os gladiators‚ to ¹

court popularity by shows (see Friedl. ii.

Ρ3;27) till the practice was forbidden by j>

Nero· see 13. 31, 4.
14. ubi.

‘ubi abiectum reliqueris? cp.‘abiect1:i ιιι ⁸
eo oco -

via cadaveris’ Suet. Ner. 48;
abiecit’ Id. Galb. 20.
¹5· sepultura invident..- The com—

plete form of this construction would .,
have also a dative of the person. It ’ 1
is noticed by Quint. (9. 3, 1) among .⁷ ·.

the conceits of his day,‘ paene iam, quid-
quid loquimur, figura est, ut hac re invi-

der,e non, ut omnes veteres et Cicero ’ ,
praecipue, huic rei? 1t 1s especially com- - ,¹
mon in the Epistles of Pliny (as 2. 10, 2, “ ¹

etc.), but is found earlier, as ‘non invi-

.abieeeris; equivalent to ,¹³
