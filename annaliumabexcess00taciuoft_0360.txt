15 claudunt. .

1. tirone, sing. as frequently ‘miles,'
‘eques‚’ etc. On the forces here spoken
of, see above, c. 78, 3.

2. in numerum legionis composu—
erat, ‘he had formed into a body nume-
rically equal to a legion? A similar ex-
pression is used of Catiline in Sall. Cat.
56, 2 ‘legiones (duas) numero expleve-
rat.’ The nearly similar expression, in
H. 1. 87, 1, has (according to Nipp.) a
different meaning. On this force of ‘in, ’
cp. Introd. v. 560³).

3. provincia. The MS. has‘ provin-
ciam; 'but we cannot say‘ arceor pro-
vinciam; ‘ nor can we well (with Pfitzn.
p. 139) {ake the words to mean that the
province <i e. its population) was debar-
red from joining him3 sor‘ arceri’ must
clearly have the same subject as‘ venire?

4 accitu; only used in abl. sing„
and apparently only found here and in

Cic. Verr. ii. 3. 28, 683 Verg. Aen. 1.
677 t rent i e they had onl to
sta⁵11de1crinl⁸ii1⁸efthere¹vvouldbe no battlg.
6. pugnaturis, concise abl. abs, as
‘daturis’ 15. 52, 3, etc.: cp. Introd. v.

ξ 54 d-
parentem, c. 55, 4.

7. si iure ageretur. On the apparent
reminiscence here of Livy, see Introd v.
§9⁷ 2

8. pro munimentis. This, like‘ pro
castris’ 3. 2ο, 2; ‘pro muris 14. 25,1,
appears clearly from the rest of the pas-
sage to mean ‘outside the fortifications.'
On the more usual meaning, cp. c. 13, 4.

10. veterani. This word is not here
strictly used, but only of trained legio-
naries, as opposed to‘ tirones' (cp. 1. 28,
8), or to mixed troops.

ordinibus ae subsidiis, ‘in centuries
and reserves? On the abl. see Introd.
v. ξ 28.

hinc . . . inde, opposed, like ‘hinc’

. . ‘illincz’ cp. 13. 38, 3.

1 1. asperitas. The strong difference in
the senses of this word as applied to
soldiers and places makes the zeugma
here harsh; but the supposition that· vis'
or‘ virtus’ has dropped out (see Halm.
Comm. Crit.) seems needless. ‘Asperitas’
is used, of persons, ’ generally in a bad
sense; but ⁶ asper ’ is a Vergilian general

“ epithet of battle, and of warlike nations

(Aen. 1, 14) or persons (Id. 11, 664).

12. agrestia. Nipp. compares the de-
ῗὲἷίιὲῖιέῗοίἶιιιςὸὲᾶέᾗειῖιιξ ’ὤᾶῗὶιη 2512}ng 1263?
and the description of the Catilinarian
army in Sall. Cat. 56, 3.

aut ad. The MS. has ‘aut' alone,
which Nipp. follows the old edd. in alter-
ing to ‘adl This would make the sen-
tence further describe the rustic weapons·
it is perhaps better, by reading‘ aut ad’
(with Weissenb. )‚ or ‘aut subitum' ιιι usum’
(with Doed.‚) to make it describe other
weaponS‚ more distinctly warlike, but ex-
temporised.

in manus, ‘to close quarters! In
this sense Tacitus seems to prefer to use
