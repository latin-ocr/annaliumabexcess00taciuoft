¹ 4. Sisenna Statilio [Tauro] The
name is thus given in the Fasti (Henzen
Α 64223 C. 1. L. i. p. 475), but the mention
’ζ of another cognomen, after one cognomen
ἱ· and a gentile name, is noted by Ritter as
conhary to the usage of Tacitus. The
‘'a'' fun names in Dio (Argum. of B. 57) are
,Σ W- T. Statilius T. f. Sisenna Taurus, and L.
· ν ss, Scribonius L. f. Libo. On the latter, see

sketch os the poliey of Rome towards
Parthia and Armenia from the time of
Augustus to that of Nero, see Introd. to
vol. ii. The Phraates here mentioned
was the fourth of that name and fifteenth
king of the dynasty, and reigned from
B.c. 37 to B.c. 2. The repulse of the
Romans alluded to is that of M. Anto-
nius and his lientenant Oppius Statianus
in 718, B.c. 36. The force under the
latter was annihilated. See Dio, 49.

officia. The chief mark of respect
lay in his restoration, in 734, Rc. 20, of
the standards taken from Crassus and
others (Dio, 54. 8, 1). Cp. ‘Parthos

trium exercituum Romanomm spolia et .

signa reddere mihi, supplicesque amici-
tiam populi Romani petere coegi ' (Mon.
Anc. v. 40). The homage alleged here,
and in Hor. Ep. 1. 12, 27, would appear
from Dio (l. 1.) to be overstated.
