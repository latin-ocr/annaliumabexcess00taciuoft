Jurfu‘o,

sitan et levia memoratu videri non nescius sum: sed nemo
annales nostros cum scriptura eorum contherit, qui veteres

apopuli Romani res conposuere.

ingentia illa bella, expugna-

tiones urbium, fusos captosque reges, aut si quando ad interna
praeverterent, discordias consulum adversum tribunos, agrarias w*
frumentariasque leges, plebis et optimatium certamina libero

-rerum motus oriuntur.

singuli regunt: delecta ex iis et consociata rei publicae forma
laudari facilius quam evenire, vel si evenit, haud diuturna esse

¹} 1. levia memoratu; so ‘vix credibile

memoratu’ H. 2. 73, 1: cp. ‘dignum
ff memoratu' Liv. 4, 43, 1.

a. annales nostros: cp. 3. 65, 1. On
the application of this title to this work
of Tacitus, see Introd. i. p. 5.

2 ⁷ aoriptura: cp. 3. 3, 2.

mutenderit = ‘comparaveritz’ so in
12. 1, η 13. 3, 35 and in Cic.‚ etc. On
the tense, cp. Introd. v. ξ 51 c.
veteres p. Β. res: cp. 1. 1, 43
, &om which it would appear that such
¹ ἀη expression includes the whole period
1 βοτη to the time of Aetium.

· *ils- conposuere: cp. ‘res . . . compo-
³‘ ὕπ’ 1. 1, 5. The MS. ‘csspossiuere²
ι appears to show trace of an archaic form
ι ‘conposivere.'

< 5. praeverterent. As the deponent
Ἐᾶτε elsewhere to be always used in
’ phrase (cp. 2. 55, 6), Nipp. thinks
it probable that here ‘praeverterentur'
'kould be read.

⁶. nb⁶¹f⁰ egressu: ‘egressus' probably
nnus ⁸ digression: as in Quint. 4. 3, 12 ;
the foreign history being looked on as
¹ the main theme from which they some-
times turned aside. Nipp. rather takes
the. words to mean, ‘with room to ex-
penate? great events giving scope for
grandem· of style.

7. in arto, ‘in a restricted field?
ῙΙ the similar expression ‘in tenui
ὣστ’ (Verg. G. 4, 6), the thought is
, num of the thing on which the toil is

spent.

    

’τῂν-ε

and Gell. On the point of view from
which this foreign policy is regarded, see
Introd. viii. p. 119.

10. magnarum rerum motus ori-
untur, ‘great events are set in motion?
Compare the sentiment of Livy (27. 9, Ι),
‘ex parvis rebus saepe magnarum mo-
menta pendent ;’ and that of Aristotle
(Pol. 5. 4, Ι), ’γίγνονται αι’ στάσεις
οὐ περὶ μικρῶν ἀλλ’ ἐκ μικρῶν. The ex—
pression used by Tacitus seems to show
that this distinction had not escaped
him·

12, Nam, etc. The thought is that,
under whichever of the possible forms of
government you live, politieal sagacity
implies a study of the character of the
sovereign power„

13. delecta exiis, etc. Such a govem-
ment was the ideal of Polybius (6. 3, 7),
and of Cicero, who says ‘ quartum quod-
dam genus maxime probandum censeo
quod ex his quae prima dixi moderatum
et permixtum tribus' (de Rep, 1. 29, 45 :
cp· also 35, 54³ 45, 693 2· 23, 41).
Polybius further (6. 11, 6) finds the
nearest realisation of such an ideal in the
Roman constitution at his time. Tacitus
need not be supposed to deny that most
stable constitutions have been more or
less mixed; but only to assert that an
ideal equilibrium is impossiblel He
would consider the Roman government
to have been not so much at any one
time a combination of all three forms, as
at different times an exemplification of
