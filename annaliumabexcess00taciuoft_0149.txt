CHARA CTER AND GOVERNMENT OF TIBERIUS. 131

Distinctions must be again drawn, as before. Much noble and much
innocent blood, no doubt, was shed 3 but much that was noble was
probably not innocent, and much was neither noble nor innocent, but
that of the creatures of Seianus, who had staked their chances on his
success. None need pity Latinius Latiaris ¹, Vescularius Flaccus ², Julius
Marinus ³, Fulcinius Trio ⁴, or any others of the like description3 nor is
anything recorded even of so prominent a man as Asinius Gallus, or of
many others, which should make them deserving of special sympathy:
the suicide of Cocceius Nerva ⁶, probably also of Arruntius ⁰, is their
own gratuitous act. But there are circumstances of horrible cruelty in
the execution of the young children of Seianus ⁷, and of the aged mother
of Fufius Geminus ⁸, and in the causes assigned for the destruction of
the descendants of Theophanes⁹: and even if these were all, such

'cases are hardly palliated by being few.

The tales of abominable profligacy ¹⁰ are more difficult to discuss or
deal with. A life prolonged without medical aid to the age of seventy-
eight may be pleaded as counter evidence ¹¹ ς retirement gave abundant
scope for fabrication of scanda13 archives of state trials may often
have preserved record of mere unproved or even disproved libels, ac·
cepted in later times as facts ¹²3 nor do older writers, as Philo aud
Josephus, Seneca and the elder Pliny, show any knowledge of the
orgies of Capreae. On the other hand, such testimony as we have is
definite and circumstantial, and states that latterly no concealment was
attempted ¹³. The history of language is also made to furnish evidence ;
the age was certainly one of growing profligacy 3 and the characters of
two at least of the companions of his solitude, Gaius Caesar and Aulus
Vitellius ¹⁴, are beyond rehabilitation.

There are still flashes of vigour, as in the blow which struck down
Seianus3 and the display of energy in the East into which the taunts
of the Parthian king had goaded him ¹⁶. Again, if he was keen to fill
the ‘fiscus ¹⁶,' he could still be munificent in the use of it, either to
restore financial confidence¹⁷, or, as before, to relieve the sufferers by
a fire ²⁸. He still organizes the corn-supply of Rome ¹⁹; even interests
himself in such minor matters as the authenticity of the Sibylline canon ²⁰.

In general, however, the administration is described as sinking into
