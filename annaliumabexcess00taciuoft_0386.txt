1. discumberet. This verb is used
by post-Augustan writers os a single per-
son, but only where the presence of others
is implied: cp. 4. 54, ²3 6. 50, 5.

2. visu. This appears to be an ex-
tension of the modal ablative (see Introd.
v. ξ 28) to denote an attendant circum·
stanoe, such as would usually be express·
ed by an abl. abs. ‘tot adstantibus et vi-
dentibus: ' see Nipp. on 4, 51.

3. offerebat, sc. ‘in tormenta.’ His
own slaves could be questioned as to the
procuring and preparing of the poison3
and the ‘ministri' who waited at table,
and who would be servants of Germani-
cus, could be examined on what had
taken place at the meal.

5. Caesa-r. That Tiberius presided at
this trial, is shown by his putting the
question to the consul (c. 17, 8).

6. scripsissent expostulantes. Nipp.
appears rightly to argue that the gap
here is considerable. So far the accu-
sation and defence appear to have been
conducted according to the programme
laid down in c. 13, 1. Now we hear that
the accusation was renewed and the de-
fence abandoned (c. 15, 4), and the trial
still prolonged after I‘iso's death (c. 17,
6). It is inserted that a ‘ comperendina-
tio’ had ensued, with introduction os new
matter, possibly some charge made by
Piso against Germanicus, which had led

to a counter-demand for the productiori
of some private letters. ‘ Expostulantes ’
is used as in 1. 19, 35 12. 46, 3; 15. 17,
5, ete.

9. temperaturos manibus: cp. ‘ risui
temperare ’ (13. 3, 2), etc.

10. Gemonias. Usually thus abbre- ·
viated, as in 5. 9, 3; 6. 25, 4, etc.‚ but
in full, ‘ Gemoniae scalae,’ in Val. Max.
6. 3, 3, etc. These stans, on which the
bodies of criminals were exposed, led
from the Capitol to the Forum, near the
Mamertine prison. This destruction of
statues may be illustrated from the de-
scription of the sall of Seianus (Juv. πο,

12. deductus, ‘he was escorted home? ¹

custos saluti: see Introd. v. ξ 19.

13. mortis exactor, ‘ exactor: by itself,
is thus used in 11. 37, 4. The sense ap-
pears to originate with Livy, who has ,
’ exactor supplicii' in 2. 5, 5. '⁴

¹ C
0222..‘³¹32¹.3f.3²²²3.13.;..÷ &2333 titt: «;;;
bitter allusion to his mother's ascendancy
over him (see 4. 57, 4).

16. mediae, ‘hung in the balance.' ³--

εἰ ita ferret. This phrase is re-‘³
peated from H. 2. 44, 4. and appears tof'
occur nowhere else. It is an abbre-⁴
viation of such forms as ‘fors tulit *⁵
(Sall6. Jug. 78, 2), or ‘res tulit’ (Liv. 3. ¹
27, ). ³
