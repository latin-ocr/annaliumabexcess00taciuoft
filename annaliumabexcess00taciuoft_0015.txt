PREFACE. ix

that, with some allowance for possible oversights, I be-
lieve that I have verified all which are not expressly
cited at secondhand, and that I have also verified and
consulted a very large number more, which, for various
reasons, it did not seem necessary to insert.

To any who have carried their studies deeply into
the vast array of literature on Tacitus enumerated in
the ‘Bibliotheca Scriptorum Classicorum’ of Engelmann
and Preuss (8th ed.‚ Leipzig, 1882)1‚ such a list of works
made use of as is given above, or to be gathered from
the whole of this volume, will seem meagre in the
extreme; and, even if only well-known writers be taken
account of, I sear that the most competent critics will be
mainly impressed by the omissions ; while many will think
that, even as it is, the text has been overloaded with
commentary‚ or that space should have been made for
more valuable material by the rejection of much that has
been inserted. I venture still to hope that the book
may give more assistance than has been hitherto easily
accessible to the general student of this portion of
Tacitus, and that some, at least, of its shortcomings are
such as may be pardonable in the work of an isolated
student, whose opportunities of intercourse with scholars
and historians are but occasional, and to whom many
valuable works that should have been consulted are
unavoidably unknown.

Ι have further to apologise for the accompanying list
of errors noticed‘since the revision of the proofs, and to
trust that, by thus prominently calling attention to them,
I may in some instances save a reader from being misled.
From their existence, and from remembrance of the
·many others detected at earlier stages of the work, I

closely printed in small type, are taken up and the list of separate treatises on special
