1. modestia.. Here ‘subordinatiom’
as c. 49, 6, etc. Cp. e. 11, 1.

‘ proles indiscreta' Verg. Aen. 10, 392.
These several eries are shouted at once
confusedly.

pretia vacationum: see on c. 17, 6.

5. propriis nominibus, ⁸ s cificall .’
They complain of hard ποι-Ε generfflly‚
and particularise these kinds of it.

6. incusant. Such a position of a
verb belonging to two or more sentences
is noted by Nipp. as similar to that of
‘tradidit' (2. 48, 1): ‘labefecit‘ (6. 29,
5); ‘veni’ (H. 1. 83, 2); ‘cinxerant’
(H. 2. 25, 1); bnt as otherwise rare ex-
cept in poetry.

materiae lignorum, ‘timber and
finewood? The terms are thus distin-
guished byUlpian (Dig. 32. 55, pn), “ligni
appellatio nomen generale est, sed ste se-
paratur, ut sit aliquid materia, aliquid lig-
num: materia est, quae ad aedifioendum,
fulciendum necessaria est: lignum quid-
quid comburendi causa paratum est.‘ A
ι ςιῐιιίἱαι· distinction is drawn by Pliny (N.
121. 16. 40, 76, 206), ‘comus non potest
videri materies propter exilitatem, sed lig-
·num3' and ‘materies’ has this specific
sense as early as Caesar (B. G. 4. 17, 8).
θ 7. adversus otium. Sometimes con-
siderable works were under-taken with
this object: see 11. 20, 23 13. 53, 3.

8. veteranorum: see c. 17, 4. On
the question whether ‘in isdem laboribus’
hem, and ‘eosdem labores' there, are to
, be taken as exaggerations, see note on c.

9. mederetur . . . neu mortem . . .
sed finem . . . orabant. The harshness
of such a combination os constructions
with ‘orabant’ appears to be unprece-
dented3 nor is any other instance given
of a verb followed by ‘neu‘ or ‘neve'
except as coupling a coordinate verb (e. g.
16. 34, 2). Ernesti maintained that ‘mor-
tem' should either be altered to ‘more-
rentur’ or followed by ‘obirent;’ the
latter is inserted by Nipp. aster ‘labori-
bus,’ where it might have dropped out
through resemblance of sound. The
change of construction which would still
remain, from a dependent clause to a
simple case, may be paralleled by that
of ‘ augebatur' (c. 52, 1). and by several
instances of such a change in the reverse
order (Introd. v. ξ 91: Dr'ager, Synt. und
Stil, ξ 233). Others explain the con-
struction as designedly abrupt, like that
in c. 41, 2, and the accusatives as excla-
matory (see Pfitzner, p. 149).

10. exercitae: ep. c. 17, 7.

12. reposcerent, ‘ demanded of him?

’ Orelli notes that in this is implied a re-

cognition of Germanicus as the lawful
heir ; which was also probably expressed
in more distinct terms (⁴ faustis ominibus’).
Dio (57. 5, 1) represents them as going to

still greater length (αὐτοκράτορα ἑπεκάλε- ’

σαν). On the legacy demanded, see c.

13· promptas res ostentavere. This
reading, suggested by VValther and Weis-
senborn, is supported by ‘promptasque
res ostentante' (12. η, 5). Most editors
alter the MS. ‘promtas’ to ‘promptos;'
supposing ‘se’ to be supplied, as with
‘mon'tumm’ below, and in other in-
stances, such as 4. 59, 55 5. 5, 25 etc.
