This use of the word had been already
adopted by Livy (25. 11, 18) from Vergil
(Aen. 1, 33, etc.).

1. quintae et unetvioensimaes On
the departure of these legions from the
stlffimgreffilrss'p, 6ξίιὲ ἓῒέῐῗὸη, though here
described as if unknown to the reader,
had been frequently mentioned in the
‘ Histories.’ The full name, ‘Vetera
castra‚’ is given in H. 4. 21, 13 5. 14, 1.
The locality is identified by geographers
with that of Birten, near Xanten, between
Cleves and Wesel. This would well suit
the distance (sixty Roman miles) if reek-
oned from Koln. The Itinerary of Anto-
ninus (p. 370, cited by Orelli), placing it
at a distance of sixty-three ‘millia pas-
sus’ *from Bonn, cannot be correct, if
‘ Vetera ' be placed at Xanten. See note
on c. 39, 1.

3. -primi coeptaverant : see c. 31, 3.

4. paenitentia. With this ‘commi-
litonum’ may be again supplied, or it
may be taken (with N ipp.) to mean their
own penitence.

5. arma. This is osten used for ‘mi-
lites,’ as in c. 1, 3, etc. Here the legions
especially are meant, as the ‘socii’ are
mentioned separately.

classem. This was perhaps a flo-
tilla temporarily got together for use on
the river. It is known, however, that a
standing German fleet of seagoing ships
existed in the time of Drusus (Flor. 4.
12, 26; Suet. Cl. 1), and was employed
in 758. A.D. 5, by Tiberius, who carried
it to the Elbe (Vell. 2. 106, 2), and even

to the Cimbn', or Jutland (Mon. Anc. 5.
14). Germanicus also used (c. 60, 3) and
augmented it (2. 6, 2). It is styled in iu- ·
scriptions ‘Classis Germanica’ (or ‘Au-
gusta Germanica ’) P. F. (‘pia fidelis ’):
see Orelli 36oo; Henzen 6865-6867.
8. Illyrico. This is often not dis-
tinguished from Pannonia: see e. 52. 3.
10. invalida et inermia, ‘the feeble
and defenceless elementt' cp. ‘quod im-
becillum aetatess ete. (c. 56, 3). Nipp.
has here collected many instances from
Tacitus of the substantival application
of neuter adjectives to masc. or fem.
substantives, to denote them as beings‚·or
things, of a certain class. It is not how-
ever peculiar to him, but a classical usage :
see Madv. 211 b, Obs. 1.
11. cunctatione: see c. 11,>etc.
dissideat, ‘mutiniesz’ cp. ‘discors,'
c. 38, 1, etc. *s
1 2. adulescentium. Germanicus was
twenty-nine, Drusus probably about
twenty-six, years old. See Introd. ix. note
0, 31. ,
3 13. opponere, ⁴ to confront them with!
cessuris: cp. ‘tracturis ¹ e. 31, 1.
14. experientia: cp. c. 4, 3.
severitatis et munificentiae sum-
mum, ‘ with sovereign power to
punish and reward.’ ⁵ Severitas,' though
apparently used differently in c. 25,
35 36, 3, has certainly this force in
3. 21, 2, etc. On the genitive, see In-
trod. v. ξ 33, e, γ. The words might
also be taken, with Zumpt (447, n. 1),
like ‘praestantissimus sapientiae‘ (6. 6
2), to mean ‘severitatis et munificentiae
