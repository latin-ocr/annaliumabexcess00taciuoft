nobilitatem familiae videbatur suspectumque iam nimiae spei

Seianum ultra extulisse.

30. Fine anni concessere vita insignes viri L. Volusius et
2 Sallustius Crispus. Volusio vetus familia neque tamen prae-
turam egressa: ipse consulatum intulit, censoria etiam potestate 5
legendis equitum decuriis functus, opumque, quis domus illa

3 inmensum viguit, primus adcumulator.

Crispum equestri ortum

loco C. Sallustius, rerum Romanarum florentissimus auctor,

4sororis nepotem in nomen adscivit.

atque ille, quamquam

prompto ad capessendos honores aditu, Maecenatem aemulatus 10
sine dignitate senatoria multos triumphalium consulariumque
potentia anteiit, diversus a veterum instituto per cultum et mun-

5 ditias copiaque et afluentia luxu propior.

et ante paucos dies filiam Seiani despon-
disset! Yet it is implied in 4. 7, 3, per-
haps in 4. 39, 4, that the boy was still
at that time alive: also the only known
daughter of Seianus is still called a mere
child eleven years later (5. 9. 2), and
must at this time have been only just
born. It may be supposed that ‘desti-

. nare' here means only an informal ex-

pression os intention ; and that the actual

betrothal was some years later.

⁶ 2. ultra extulisse, ‘ to have raised
even beyond his hopes.' Nipp. thinks
this would be untrue, and that ‘ultra‚'
taken in any other way, would be pleo-
nastic3 and therefore prefers, with Al-
datus, to read ‘ultra’

5. consulatum. The fragmentary Fasti
(Henzen 64403 C. 1. L. i. p. 546) appear
to make him one of the coss, suff. of 742,
Ec. 12. Nipp. cites Borghesi and other
authorities, who show from coins and in-
omipfions that he was proconsul of Africa
in 748, B. C. 6, legatus of Syria in 758,
az.§·0²32.323.0;.3hg..{2132ff?3130 5133:
sulus, cp. 12. 22, 2, etc.; 13. 25, 1, etc.

censoria etiam potestate. Momm-
sen (staatsr. i. 343, n. 6) notes that the
inscriptions os his fieedmen (C. I. L. vi. 1,
1883 a) flatter Volusius by styling him
mser.

6. legendis equitum decuriis. The
'decuriae‘ of persons of equestrian census,
’elected for judicial purposes (see Introd.
vii. p. 87) are to be distinguished from
§he ‘ turmae’ (see on 2. 83, 5) consisting
of those selected for the ⁴ equus publicus.¹
Suetonius (Aug. 37) ascribes to Augustus

*the institution of a ‘triumviratus recog-
noscendi turmas equitum,' which is appa-

suberat tamen vigor

rently the censorial function exercised by
Volusius, and more thau once speaks of
the revision of ‘decuriae’ as a funetion
discharged by the princeps personally
(Aug. 32; Tib. 41; cp. Pl. N. H. 33. 1,
30). Mommsen (Staatsr. ii. 919, n. 1)
notes that the ‘ decuriae‘ appear later to
have been selected from the ‘ equites equo
public0.’ 1f this were so at the time of
Tacitus and Suetonius, a confusion of
‘turmae' and ‘decuriae’ becomes more
probable.

7. inmensum, adv„ as c. 52, 1 ; 4. 27,
3, etc. (ep. Introd. v. ξ 5). The wealth
os Volusius is mentioned in 14. 56, 2, as
the result of his parsimony.

adcumulata, ἄπ. εἰρ.

Crispum. Horace (Od. 2. 2, 2) ad-
dresses him as ‘inimice lamnae . . . nisi
temperato splendeat usu.' Nipp. notes
also an epigram of Krinagoras addressed
to him.

8. C. Sallustius, The historian died
in 720, B.c. 34. Though Tacitus mentions
him here only, he has throughout shown
his appreeiation of him by frequent imi-
tation: see Introd. v. ξ 97, 1.

florentissimus. This term is con· ,
stantly used by Tacitus of famous and
distinguished personS, e.g. 4. 68, 4; 71,
7³ 11- 37‚4; 16-33‚1‚ete.

9. adscivit, ‘adopted;’ cp. 1. 31, 5;
π. 60, 3, ete.

12. diversus: cp. ‘diversus a maiorum
institutis‘ 2. 2, 5.

cultum et munditias ; these are
nearly synonyms, as are also ‘copia et
afluentia,’ ‘ somnum et inertiam.’ v

13. luxu propior, ‘inclined to luxury : '
cp. ‘ famae propior' (Agr. 6. 4). Tacitus .
uses this form of the dative in e. 33, 3;
