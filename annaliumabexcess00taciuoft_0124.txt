106 INTRODUCTION.

turion ¹. Such of their duties as are still traceable can hardly be generss
ally characterized²; -and this rank becomes hardly so much one of
military promofion, as a ‘tirocinium’ for young men of the highest
rank ³, and a stepping-stone to the quaestorship and senate ⁴.

1. ‘ Vexillarii‚’ or ‘ veterani sub vexillo retenti.' Augustus had ordained
that the legionary soldier should be dismissed with gratuities after a term
of service originally fixed at sixteen ⁵, and later at twenty years' service ⁶.
Probably the same events which led to the enrolment of additional
legions, combined with the exhaustion of the ‘aerarium militare ⁷‚’ led
him to postpone his obligations by a characteristic fiction3 by which the
veterans, though removed from the legionan ressased from the oath,f''
were kept together under separate colours‚ perhaps exempted from campl
d'fltl'es and reserved for battle ⁸, but awaiting indefinitely their final dis-l
charge and reward. The words ‘ vexillum,' ⁴ vexillarii,’ and ‘ vexillatio‚'
though often used of any legionary detachment under separate command ⁹,
appear to have a special application to these troops, who are distinguished
from the legions by Tacitus in several places ¹⁰. They might be quar-
tered with ²¹, or separated from their legions ¹², and, perhaps by combina-
tion, are sometimes 1000 strong ¹⁸ 3 but if the number 500, the only
estimate of such a battalion given in these books, may be treated as the
normal strength of those belonging to one legion ¹⁴, it would agree with
the computation of Hyginus, who reckons them as equivalent to an
extra cohort ¹⁵.

2. ‘ Cohortes civium Romanorum ' are mentioned in several inscriptions,
usually as volunteers, frequently as Ital-laps 16; and may probably have
been generally formed of such as chose a military profession, and who
lived in other districts than those from which the home army was raised.
There appear to have been at one time at least thirty-two such cohorts ²⁷ ;
