(b) With accus-alive. The most characteristic usage is that adopted chiefly '.
from Sallust and from Greek usages with εἷς, ἐπί, or πρός, whereby this [
construction eapresses the effect intended or resulting3 as in the phrases
in maius vulgare, credi, audiri, etc., 3. 12, 63⁹4]ss 1; 4. 23, 2 ; aucta
in deterius 2. 82, 1 ; in falsum 3. 56, 6. So also in incertum 1. 11, 45
in lacrimas 1. 57, 5; ‘in speciem ac terrorem 2. 6, 3; in mortem 4. 45, 1;
in eundem dolorem 6. 49, 3. Roby 1974, Nipp. on 2. 13. Also to be
noted is the use of this construction with almost the force of a simple
dat„ as 1. 76, 53 2. 39, 33 48, 1 3 4. 2, 1 (see notes in each instance); Α
9, 23 12. 32, 4. For more isolated usages, see 1. 14, 33 2. 47, 23
80,7; 4. 25, 2; 56, 2512. 6, 5; 25, 1. Dr. ξ 80 b.

61. Juxta is often used metaphorically‚ both as an adverb, in the
sense of ‘pariter‚' as iuxta periculoso 1. 6, 6, etc. (Sall. and Liv.) 3 and
as a preposition, in the sense of ‘next to,' or ‘close up0n‚’ as iuxta
seditionem, iuxta libertatem 6. 13, 1 3 42, 3 (a few instances in Sall. ,
Liv. Pl. mai). Dr. ξ 100, Roby 2014, 2016.

62. Per. The accus. with this prep. has constantly the force of ,
2 simpl. abl. or an abl. with ex or in, as per acies 1. 2, 13 per
nomen 1. 17, 5;. per superbiam 1. 61, 6; per ferociam 2. 17, 1; per
occultum 4. 71, 7; per opes 6 22, 4 (where see note). Hence it is
often interchanged with such constructions, as in 1. 2, 1; 7, 103 11, 7 ,
4. 55, 7, etc. See§88. D. §§ 89, 105.

63. The following preps. are rare, andin no earlier prose: —

Abusque 13· 47 2; 15 37 5<Verg··)

Adusque 14. 58, 4 (Verg. Hor. Ov..)

Simulg. 64, 3, 4. 55, 3, 6. 9, 5(Hor. Ov. Sen. Trag. Sil..) Ap· 1
parently a Graecism founded on the usage of‘ αμα. Dr. ξ 101. Among}²
various uses of preps. no ed in their places, are those of· ab 1 26, 23 ,
