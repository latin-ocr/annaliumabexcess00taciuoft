1. magistros. The correction ‘magis-

γ’ trum’ (Halm and Ritt. after Sirker) ap-

pears to be needless. That the quinde-

’ cimviri in the time of Augustus had-Q}
, ‘magistri ’ is shown by Mommsen (Comm⁶

on Mon. Anc. p. 64) from the record of
ares of 737, A.D. 17, in

the Fasti cap. (c. 1. L. i. p. 442). Au-

gustus himself (Mon. Anc. iv. 36) and no

ἢ doubt his suecessors, were among these

ᾗ· ‘magistri3’ and it was in that capacity
v· that they held ‘ludi saeculares.'

2. infrequentem. Augustus (Dio,

· 54. 35, 1) had relaxed the rule by which

no decree could be passed without the

presence os four hundred senators.
3. vulgabantur: the indie. is inter-
posed as in 1. 10, 1, etc. >
5. deferrentur. The subject of this
is the many current prophecies mention-
ed above. Suet. (Aug. 31) says that Au-
gustus, on assuming the office of pontifex

,· maximus, after search made, burnt above
’ two thousand of the collected prophetie
’ἰ books, retaining only the Sibylline and
j making selection also among them: see
note on 1. 76, 2.

⁷ deed the force of‘et ne ’ in 11. 18, 2; 15.
ν 43, 4; but is there preceded by a clause
·· with ‘ut ‘ or ‘ ne.’

6. sociali bello. In H. 3. 72, 2, the

j date is correctly given, ‘arserat et ante
Ῐ Capitolium civili bello,' i.e. in the strug-

gle between Sulla and the Marifflar-rsqin 671,

' boldly reads ‘civili ;' Nipp. with more rea-

t

son thinks that Tacitus gave no date, and
that ‘bello sociali’ is the gloss of some
historical blunderer. The similar discre—
pancy noted in 1. 54, 1, relates to a le-
gend of which there may have been two
versions ,rthe error here is one which it is
difficult to suppose that Tacitus or any
persons to whom he read his work would
have overlooked. Until this fire the Si-
bylline book or books had been kept in
the ‘cella Iovis?

Erythrae, one of the Ionian cities opposite
Chios, now Ritri, where many remains of
it exist: by ‘Italicae coloniae' the cities
of Magna Graecia are meant. A lost
work of Varro, cited by Dion. Hal. (4. 62)
and Laetant. (de fals. rel. c. 6) recognised
(according to the latter) ten distinct Sibyls,
the Persian, Libyan, Delphian, Cimmerian,
Erythraean‚ Samian, Cumaean, Hellespon-
tian, Phrygian, and Tiburtine; of whom
the Cumaean was most famous : for further
particulars, see Marquardt, iii. 336.

of ‘noscere' (c. 9, 7).

expressions, cp. 2. 87, 1.

iuxta seditionem ventum: cp.
‘ usque ad seditionem ventum est ' 14. 42,
2. The expression is founded partly on
‘iuxta sediti0nem esse' (Sall. H. iii. 67
D, 77 K, 76 G), partly on ‘prope sediti-
onem venire’ (Liv. 26. 48, 8). On the
use os‘ iuxta‚’ see Introd. v. 5 61.
