    

TA CI TUS’ USE OF HIS MA TERIALS. 25

Syria cannot be dated before 785, 'An 32 ¹. This again is met by refer-
⁸ring ‘confestim’ to Piso alone; which, if open to no other objection‚
spoils the point of the story by destroying the plausible connection of
cause and effect, and by making Suetonius gravely connect this appoint-
ment with a debauch of some fifteen years before it, when the consul-
ship ² and the governorship of Moesia⁸ had intervened. The suggestion
is surely more probable that Tacitus was aware of this story, saw its
inconsistency with facts and dates, and rejected it without even no'ticing it.

In spite, however, of his diligence‚ his firm conviction of his own
· impartiality‚ and his belief that he treads on firmer ground 1n describing
'³ times further off from his own, it has been the general verdict of modern
, criticism, that‘ the Histories of Tacitus are moreetsi be relied on than his

Annali} ξ’ and the latter are even maintained to be‘ almost wholly

satire ⁶.' The very excellences of the book are also noted as its defects.

It &not in the bare facts, which, as stated above, are rarely known to be

erroneous, and not often suspected of being so; but 1n the artistic treat-

ment of the facts, the brilliant colouring, the effective contrasts‚ above all,
⁴. in the subtle interpretatiopf‘of motives‚ that the injustice is mostly con·
ceived to lurk.

Again, the further he recedes from his own time, the greater, instead
of the less, becomes the suspicion of unfairness. His portraiture of
Claudius and Nero is less assailed than that of Tiberius, which, although
the most elaborate analysis of character in all his writings‚ is also most
often attacked as untrustworthy.

It will be the work of other chapters to follow him in detail through
the whole period, and to point out such inconsistencies and unfairnesses
as may seem traceable: but we may here notice such general considera-
tions as make it probable that he has dealt less than justice to the early
{s Caaears. 5 ' “

’ One chief cause will be found in the fact that in athe'Annals generally,
and in the early portion especially, he is beyond the limits of his own
ἐ knowledge, and forced to depend on written authorities3 and in the

generally to have spent the force of its historica] judgment in dealing
with discrepancies between informants‚ without recognising the in-
