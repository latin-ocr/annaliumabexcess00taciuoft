patriae Tiberius, a populo saepius ingestum, repudiavit; neque
in acta sua iurari quamquam censente senatu permisit, cuncta
mortalium incerta, quantoque 'plus adeptus foret, tanto se magis
3 in lubrico dictitans. non tamen ideo faciebat fidem civilis animi;
nam legem maiestatis reduxerat, cui nomen apud veteres idern,
sed alia in iudicium veniebant, si quis proditione exercitum aut
plebem seditionibus, denique male gesta re publica maiestatem
populi Romani minuisset : facta arguebantur, dicta inpune erant.
4 primus Augustus cognitionem de famosis libellis specie legis eius
tractavit, commotus Cassii Severi libidine, qua viros feminasque
inlustres procacibus scriptis diffamaverat : mox Tiberius, consul-

1. ingestum, ‘imposed by acclama-
tion;' more usually of reproacheS, etc„
as 4. 42, 1, etc.

2. in acta sua iurari. This oath, an
outgrowth of that taken in respect of the
laws by the old magistrates (Mommsen,
Staatsr. i. p. 600), is found in 709, B.C.

*453 the formula being ‘se nihil contra
acta Caesaris facturum' (App. B. C. 2.
106) ; and was ensorced more stringently,

or, e rmmwrs on an. 1, 12, ΒΕ.
⁴² (Ῑζίο, 47. 18, 3): in respeci of the
acta of Augustus. it is first mentioned
as taken in 729, 13.c. ²9 (Id. 51. 20, 1).
Tiberius himself took the oath to the
acta of Augustus (Id. 57. 8, 5), and en-

, forced it strictly (see 4. 42, 3) ; and the
oath, as time went on, upheld the ‘ acta ’
osall princes not specially passed over, as
became the case with Tiberius himself
(Dio, 59. 9, 1). It was taken on Jan. 1,
first by magistrates, then by all senators
(see 13. 11, 1; 16. 22, 13 Dio, 53. 28, 1;
58. 17, 3), and must not be confounded
with ,the ‘sacramentum in nomen prin-
cipis' (see c. 7, 3).

permisit. The use of this verb with
accus· and inf. pass„ as in 14. 12, 7,
etc„ and Livy, as also that of ⁶ oro ’ (1 1.
10, 8), and other verbs denoting permis-

usage of the best writers : see also
Dr'ager, Synt. und Stil, § 146, and notes
one-7⁴, 7³ 79, 3-

4. in lubrico: cp. 6. 51, 3. Other
metaphorioel uses os the'word occur in
2. 87, ² 3 6. 49, 3, etc.

5. legem maiestatis reduxerat. On
the history of this law and its application
under the RepubHc, see Introd. viii. p.
121. The same expression is used in
Pliny. Pan. 11 ‘dicavit caelo Tiberius

Augustum. sed ut maiestatis legem re·
duceret;’ but the implied assertion that
it had become obsolete must be qualified
by the fact of its extension and recent en·
forcement by Augustus ι see below.

6. si quis . . . seditionibus. These
two instances seem cited from Cicero,
who specifies them as cases falling under
the law (de Orat. 2. 39, 164; Partitt. 30,
105). The idea of some such verb as
‘laesisset ' is supplied by zeugma from
‘minuisset.'

8. populi Romani. These words seem
intended to stand in contrast to its appli-
cation in later time to the ‘ maiestas' of
the princeps only.

dieta inpune erant. That pas-
quinades were capitally punishable, even
by the laws of the Twelve Tables, is
affirmed in Cic. de Rep. 4. 10, ης cp.
Hor. Ep. 2. ι, 150, etc. On the applica-
bility of the law of ‘ maiestas’ to thern,
see next note. ‘Inpune esse’ is found
again, 2. 52, 9; 3. 28, 23 12. 54, 1.; G.
25, 2; ‘impune habendum’ 3. 70, 3.

9. primus Augustus: cp. Suet. Aug.
55. Seneca says (de Ben. 3. 27, 1) ‘sub
divo Augusto nondum hominibus verba
sua periculosa erant, iam molesta! Yet
the ‘Lex Cornelia‚’ even if allowed to
slumber, appears definitely to have brought
spoken libels under this offence. ‘Est
maiestas. et sic Sulla voluit, ne in quem-
vis impune declamari liceret’ (Cic. ad
Fam. 3. 11. 2).

10. Gaesii Severi. On his character,
see 4. 21, 5. He was probably banished
in 765, A. D. 12, when Dio (56. 27, ¹)

mentions proceedings taken against libel· .

lers, but does not give their names. The
chronology of Jerome (see on 4. 21, 5)
would give a date four years earlier.

1 1. diffamaverat. This verb, first found
in Ovid, is used of a personal object also
