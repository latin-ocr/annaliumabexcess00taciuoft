THE SVNTAX AND STVLE OF TACITUS. 35

more usual application to the bodily members, but in such expressions
as clari genus 6. 9, 53 adlevatur animum 6. 43, 3; and in the military

phrase frontem . . . tergum . . . latera . . . munitus 1. 50, 2. Dr. ξ 39,Wolfflin
(Phil. 25, 115).

12. 'transitive accusatives. Dr. ξ 40.

 

(a) Tacitus often expresses the effect or purpose of an action by an

ἰ

5 ‘accusative clause in (so-called) apposition to the sentence, i. e. explanatory

of the notion contained in the verb and its adjuncts3 such verb imply-
ing some general notion of doing or suffering on which these accusa-
tives depend. See 1. 27, 1 (and Nipp. there); 49, 5; 74, 3; 2. 64, 63
6. 37, 2, etc. Instances are found in Sallust and Livy.

(b) The poetical accusative with verbs expressz'ngr affections is not un-
frequent in Tacitus, and is extended by him to some instances not found
in earlier prose, as pavescere 1. 59, 7, etc; expavescere H. ⁴2. 76, 3;

’ gravari H. 2. 20, 2. Cp. Madv. 223 c, Roby 1123, Kennedy 127.

(c) A full list is given by Dr. of compound verbs used ᾇγ Tacitus with
4 a simple accusative where α repetition (gf the prepositz'on or a dative would be
ἕ regular. To verbs previously so used in prose he would appear to have

added several, as advehi (with acc. pers.) 2. 45, 4; advolvi 1. 13, 7, etc.;
J elabi 1. 61, 6, etc.; erumpere 12. 63, 2; exire 6. 49, 33 intervenire 3. 23,
1 ; inrepere 4. 2, 3 ; praecellere 2. 43, 7 ; praeiacere 12. 36, 4 ; praeminere
g 3. 56, 2, etc. His chief characteristic in this respect is the number of
’ὲ -verbs so used by him. On the general usage, see Roby 1121, Zumpt
387, note.

(d) The Graecism, introduced by Vergil and occasionally found in
prose from Sallust, of an accusative of the object after middle and passive
,si verbs, generally confined to induor and similar verbs, is used by Tacitus
with more latitude, e. g. falsa exterritus 4. 28, 4 (MS.); arguitur plera-
ἐζ. que, . . . quae revincebatur 6. 5, 1, 2. This must be carefully distinguished-
· from the usage above (§ 11); as ‘indutus vestem’ is a wholly diffe-

Ἴ rent accus. from ‘indutus humeros.’ See Roby 1126, 1127, Kennedy
123.

    

13. 'l'he poetical or Greek adverbial accusative of a neuter
γ adjective is adopted, as falsum renidens 4. 60, 3. To this head belong
j several of the adverbial adjectives noted above (ξ 5). This construction
is akin to that noted above (§ 12 d); as is also the quasi-cognate accus.
2 with vincere 12. 60, 5, and pervincere 14. 14, 3. Dr. ξ 41, Roby 1096,
² 1100, Kennedy 122, 5.
