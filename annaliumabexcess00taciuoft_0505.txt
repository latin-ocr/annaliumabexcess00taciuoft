tus and not finished it.

For a similar offence, Augustus had al-
ready deprived them of autonomy in 734,

it five years later (Id. 23, 7).

Cap.: see C. Ι. L. i. p. 550). His father
was a follower of Antonius (Hor. Sat. 1.

10. destrictior. Τ1ιε metaphoris taken
from a sword ever drawn. We should
rather speak figuratively of a person whose
sword was always out, or who ‘had thrown
away the scabbard! Nipp. gives instances
of the word from val. Max„ who has
‘destricta censura’ (2. 9, 6), ‘vindicta'
(6. 3, 1), ‘feneratrix’ (8. 2, 2): cp p. also
‘destricte minatus' (Pl. Epp. 9. 21, 4).

This desire appears to arise srom a simi-
lar motive to that of As ia (c. 15, 4),
namely, their gratitude for the punish-
ment of Serenus.
