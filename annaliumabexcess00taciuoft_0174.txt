H. 1. 1 should be compared with this. On Ξ
the apparent belief of Tacitus in his own
imparfiality, see Introd. iv. p. 22, soll.

low, with some rhetorical license, of sels-
inflicted deaths. ·

public.' It is implied that the forces of?
the tn'umvirs, as well as those of Pom-
peius, were mere ⁸ privata arma,' and that
Brutus and Cassius represented the State.
On the other hand, in Mon. Anc. i. ιο,
they are represented as exiles by judicial‘

1. veteris populi, etc. The expres-
sion is varied in 4. 32, 1, to ‘veteres
populi Romani res.' In H. r. 1, 1 ‘dum
res populi Romani memorabantur' is
used to imply an antithesis, perhaps not
wholly absent in the other places, between
national history and mere ¹ res principum.’

tive, see Introd. v. 5 18; and on the
gerundive dative with ‘ defuere,' Id. ξ 22
b. This use of ‘dicere,' though mainly

’ poetical, is found in Sall. (Jug. 95, 2)
and Liv. (7. 29, 1, etc.).

3. decora ingenia, e. g. Pollio, Livy,
Q. Labienus, Cremutius Cordus, and
others. Some writers of later history, as
M. Seneca and Aufidius Bassus, included
the time of Augustus in their work. See
Introd. iii. p. 11, 12.

4. deterrerentur. On the use os the
subj. of facts with ‘ donec,’ see Introd. v.
ξ 53. The reason here assigned may have
been that which induced Livy to conclude
his history in 745, B.C. 9.

of conjunctions is often adopted sor
elegance (see Introd..v. ξ 89), but here,
as Nipp. suggests, is intended to combine
in pairs the two Julian and two Claudian
Caesars, as in H. 2. 76, 4.

5. falsae, ⁴ falsified,' as. ‘falsae tabu-
lae' (Suet. Aug. 19), etc.

6. compositae. ‘ Componere res' is
condensed expression, like ‘componera
Iliaca tempora‘ Vell. 1. 3, 2, ete. On
the chief historical works which Tacitus

may have used, see Introd. iii. pp. 10—14. “

7. cetera. i. e. to the death of Nero,
after which the ‘ Histories,' already pub-
lished, begin.

‘ beneficium.’ The whole passage in

death took place in Asia in the following
year. Lepidus was at the same time
‘ stripped of power’ (‘exut0 ') ; his army
of twenty legions being induced to desert
him, and no office lest to him but that of
‘ Pontifex maximus‚’ which he was allowed
to retain in seclusion at Circeii till his
death in 742, B.c. 14. -.
11. Iulianis, ‘Caesariam’ This term,
applied to the troops of Julius Caesar
(Suet. Jul. 75), as is also ‘Caesarianil
(Bell. Afr. 13, 1), is here applied aste}
his death to the party of the triumvirsj
as that of the senate or ‘optimates’ 12
still, after the death of its leader‚ styleq
‘ Pompeianae partes' (e. 10, 1). Sexi}
Pompeius is regarded here 'as exter-nal td
