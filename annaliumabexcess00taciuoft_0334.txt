Graeci. The general term may be
used to speak of his reception at other
cities besides Athens.

1. vetera suorum facta dietaque.
The Greeks are called ‘laetum antiqui-
tatibus genus’ in H. 2. 4, 13 and Sulla,
during the siege of Athens, was incensed
by a deputation which talked to him ‘of
Theseis, Eumolpus, and the Persian war'
(Plut. Sull. 13, 460). The expression
‘facta dictaque’ is used as a formula in
c. 28, 3; 3. 65, 13 4. 37, 436. 24, 1‚etc.

praeferentes, ‘ making a display
of:’ so ‘modestiam,’ ‘imitamenta,’ ‘li-
bertatem,' ‘auctoritatem praeferre’ (13.
45, 2; 14- 57, 53 16· 22, 8; 32, 3); also
‘aviam,' ‘avunculum praeferebat’ 4. 75,
2.

2. quo plus dignationis, etc„ ¹ to add
to the honour of their obsequiousness,’ by
dignifying those from whom it came. Ta-
citus gives much the same estimate of the
Greek character as Juvenal (3, 74-108).
‘Dignatio’ is used by Tacitus elsewhere
in this sense (cp. 4. 52, ²3 6. 27, 23 13.
42, 8; H. 3. 80, 3); oftener in that of
political dignity or rank (c. 33, 53 3. 75,
23 4. 16, 6, etc. The word is rare in
earlier writers.

3. tramisit Lesbum. The verb in
this sense does not usually take an accus-
without prep.‚ but Livy has *Uticam . . .
transmisit’ (25. 31, 12).

Perinthum ; on a promontory pro-
jecting into the Propontis; an old and

probably the local magistrates who had .
pillaged their own treasuries (cp. 4. 45, 5)

communities in Cilicia ‘perditas . . . pet ‘
magistratus suos ' (ad Fam. 3. 8, 5 ; cp. ad y
Att. 6. 2, 5),and Pliny found a similar state ll
