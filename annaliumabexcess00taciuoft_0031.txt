by Tacitus in the later books must have been those alluded to by him².
of these, M. Cluvius Rufus is known to us as a consular before the
death of Gaius ², the ¹companion of Nero to Greece³, legatus of Spain
under Galba ⁴, and as one of the train of Vitellius ⁶. His work has
been thought to have begun as early as the time of Gaius, and to have
*been‘ihe authority followed by Josephus in his description of that
prince’s death; it would appear to have gone down to the death of
Vitellius Β, whom the historiari outlived by about a year. The other,
‘Fabius Rusticus, is described as too partial to his patron Seneca, but
as being in eloquence and brilliancy the Livy of his age ⁷. As he
‘described Britain, his work probably began not later than the time of
Claudius ⁸. We have no allusion to it later than the time of Nero,
but he appears to have been still living in the midst of the principate
{sos Trajan ⁹.

ὲ It has been shown ²⁰ that Tacitus had consulted the special history
{pf Domitius Corbulo ¹¹ ,· and he may also have used that of Suetonius
&Paulinus ¹²: but with these our definite knowledge of even the names of
>>original authorities sor this period ends. Bruttedius Niger, aedile in 775,
ΑΔ). 22 ¹³, was a writer of history, but our only reference is to his notice
os the death of Cicero ¹⁴. The references to Lentulus Gaetulicus, the
⁴poet and epigrammatist, hardly prove him to have been also a his-
''torian ¹⁵3 Cremutius Cordus appears to have left off at an earlier date ¹⁶3
Vipstanus Messala ¹⁷, and probably Licinius Mucianus ¹⁸, to have begun
vat a later.

⁷ Further contemporary materials would no doubt be found in separate
notices of famous men, not only in the form of funeral orations, but
*also in that of more detaffl-¹3{9.8flssphie32 such as those of Thrasea and
‘Helvidius by Arulenus Rusticus and Herennius Senecio, and such
*other precedents as Tacitus alludes to for his own biography of
