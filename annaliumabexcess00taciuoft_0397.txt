oentia’ is a musal abl. It might be so
, taken here, with ⁸ ausus‚’ as meaning that
the influence of his brother emboldened
him to entreat. It would appear, how-
ever, that he entreated, not in person, but
through his powerful brother. ‘ Potentia '
would thus mean ‘per potentiam,' and
would be a quasi· instrumental abl.
Neither view seems wholly satisfactory,
and the suggestion that ‘ fretus ’ has been
lost is tempting, though some other order
of words (as ‘fratris potentia fretus ‘) is
more probable than the immediate juxta-
‚position (‘fratris fretus’) of Bezzenberger,
tud would equally suggest a possibility
that ‘fretus’ might have been dropped
out or corrupted. The M. Silanus here
meantis not the consul of the preceding

year (2. 59, 1), but the father-in·1aw of

,Galus (see on 6. 20, 1), and was cos. suff.

sibi tamen, etc., ‘ for himself, his fa-
ther's resentment towards him survived in
its sulness; and the return of Silanus
implied no relaxation of any intention of
Augustus', i. e. the renouneement of friend-
ship would be maintained. It is to be
remarked that this ban was of itself suf-
ficient to exclude him from all the magis-
tracies of the state.

13. Papia Poppaea.. On this and the
previous ‘Iuliae rogationes' see the Ex-
cursus appended to this Book. The
plural used here of the latter appears
hardly to be such a rhetorical plural as
‘Oppiis . . . legibus' (c. 33, 4), but may
denote that Augustus had passed more
than one marriage law in his own name.

14. incitandis . . . poenis, ‘to encou-
rage the enforcement of penalties on
celibacy.‘ Some penalties had already
existed, but fresh vitality was given to
them by the reward held out to in-
formers.

16. praevalida. This is commonly
taken to mean ‘continued to prevail;’
but the analogy of ‘praevalida vitia' (c.
53, 2), ‘nomina’ (12. 60, 6), ‘pars' (H. ,
2. 52, 2), and of ‘praevalere’ (Ι. 58, 7,
etc.)‚ suggests a better interpretation,
that childlessness gave such a power in
society as to frustrate the law. That
such was the fact, is abundantly shown
