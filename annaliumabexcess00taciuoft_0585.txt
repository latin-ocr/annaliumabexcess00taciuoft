1. aegrius distrahebant, ‘they had
the more difficulty in selling: ’ men saw
ἐξ the senex’s necessity and held out sor a
lower price than would pay his debts: cp.

here would be special public banks: see
Mommsen, Staatsr. ii. p. 622.

5. populo cavisset: so ‘ut populo
prius caveretur’ Liv. 7. 21, 83 cp. 22. 60,
4. If, as appears to be impIied, the loan
was wholly from the ‘ aerarium‚’ the ac-
tion of Tiberius would be no more than
the origination of a senatus consultum.
Suetonius (Tib. 48), who makes it one
of his only two acts of public munifi-
cence, must have considered that he
advanced the loan personally from the
‘ fiscus.’

6. neque emptio ; i.e. many capitalists
who had held back for bargains in lan
ultimately purchased none at all.

8. incurioso: so ‘incuriosa historia'

have here the ruin of a whole samily;
herself, husband, father-indam father,
brother. The connexion with Theopha· ›
nes could not apply to all; but no other
charge is specified. ‘Argolicus' and
‘ Laco ' are personal cognomina.
