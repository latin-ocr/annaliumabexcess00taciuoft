6, etc. A word generally archaic, but
adopted by Tacitus from Livy.

1. extractum. This implies some
compulsion, but not necessarily physical
force: cp. ‘contuberniis extracti' (15. 13,
²); ‘rure extractus in urbem ‘ (Hor. Sat.
1. 1, 11). The case is probably abl„ as
in Horace (l. 1.); but in 6. 23, 5, the
MS. text ‘extractum custodiae' is gene·
rally accepted.

3. consternatione, ‘the tumultz’ cp.
c. 63, 3; 13. 16, 6, etc. This noun ap-
pears to originate with Livy. but the verb
(cp. H. 3. 79, 3) is found earlier.

5. eastra primae legionis. Each
legion had always more or less separate
winter quarters, though the two here may
have been in distinct portions of a com-
mon enclosure. The context implies per-
haps that his assailants followed him into
this camp, and certainly that some of the
legion, who are addressed as guilty by
Germanicus, attacked him there.

6. religione: see note on c. 183. On
the sanctity of the eagles and other stan-
dards, cp. 2. 17, 2, and ‘conversus ad
signa et bellorum deos’ (H. 3. 10, 7);
also Dion. Hal. 6, 45 ταῦτα . . . ὥσπερ zapt-
ματα θεῶν ἱερὰ νομίζεται. Catiline kept
an eagle of Marius in a shrine within his
house (Cic. Cat. 1. 9, ²4) ; and the legi-
onary eagle is stated by Dio (40. 18, 1)
to have been kept in camp in a portable
shrine. Even in old times it was a prac-
tice to swear by the standards (see Liv.
26. 48, 12). Other evidence of their

sanctityis collected by Marquardt, Staatsv,
11. p. 4² 5.

7. aquilifer. The actual bearet of the
ἳὲἕέῗηζῗοᾝξῑὲἳ ξῗιῑῗοέξῗῖἱῗῗςῖἑξὲέὲἓ
it. but is an officer of much lower rank.
mentioned in several inscriptions. See
Henzen, Index.

rarum etiam, etc. On such pa-
rentheses, see Introd. v. § 82. ,A similar
outIrIage on ‘legati ’ is similarly spoken of
in . 3. 80, 3.

9. altaria deum. These, as wellas the
standards and the image of the emperor,
stood in the principia. See 4. 2, 4.

10. noscebantur, ‘ were capable of re·
cognition:’ cp. 4. 62, 5; H. 1. 90, 3.

ingressus caetra : see above.

1 ι. imperat recepitque. The histo-
rical present is easily interchangeable
with a perfect, as 2. 7, ις 20, ²3 14. 4,
6, etc.

1 2. fatalem increpans rabiem. ‘ Ra-
bies' is thus used of mutiny in c. 31, 3.
The use of ‘fatalem' (cp'. 5. 4, 2; 15. 61,
6; and note on 3. 30, 2), which is ex·
plained by ‘deum ira' (cp¹ 16. 16, 3),
treats them as hardly responsible beings‚
and sostens the censure conveyed in ‘in-
crepans;’ from which word some such
sense as that of ‘dicens' is supplied by
⁸ zeugma ' with ‘ resurgere.'

13. ius legationis, se. ‘violatumff
On such pregnant constructionS, see In-
trod. v. ξ 84. . *rx-⁵«, « ,³ ,ω ..-

15. miseratur, ⁴ expresses sohow s0t.’
