1. adpulit. Suet. uses this verb in
fitis sense with the name of a place in the
nouus. as ‘Dertosam adpellere,‘ ‘Regium
.. . nave adpellere' (Galb. 10; Tit. 5);
'and also (Aug. 98) uses the verb, of a
dnip, absolutely, as in 4. 27, 1. Both
eomtructions are rare.

2. scopulos: There are no rocks on
uiis coast: cp. c. 23, 3.

3. oppeteret. The use of this verb
without ‘mortem’ is Vergilian (Aen. 1.
96, etc.)‚ but already adopted by Pl. mai.

4. secundante vento. With the ex-
ception of the occurrence of this same ex-
Fusion in Just. 26. 3, 4, this verb is
confined to poets. and takes an accus.

claudae, ‘crippled;' used of ships in
laun. 4, 4353 Liv. 37. 24, 63 Curt. 9.
issstfflffflsszvzsszffsssssfflffffl
5. intentis vestibus. Similar con-
}rivancee6are described in H. 5. 23, ις
nv. 12, 7.
7. Angrivarii. The correctness of the
ξ reading here depends on that in c. 22, 3.
ρ The contr-anst ‘ab interioribus' would show
¹ that they lived near the coast; and it
must be sup that some other coast-
men must have sold their prisoners in-
land. The mention of the British princes
here is an evidence of friendly relations
than· between that country and Rome.

11. monstra maris. Pedo Albinova-
nus (see on 1. 60, 2), though probably
an eyewitness, appears to have drawn on
imagination in his narrative (see Appen·-
dix I at the end of this Book) : and this
shipwreck and its wonders probably soon

to southern navigators may have supplied.

ambiguas; used similarly, with geni-
tives of the things between which the
doubt lies, in c. 40, 2. The use with a
single genitive is noted on 1. 7, 4.

15. ire . . .imperat: such an inf. is
found in poets and in Sall. On the usage
of Tacitus, see Introd. v. ς 43.

in Chattos. These expeditioris ap-
pear to be a fresh start atter the forces
had been collected at head quarters. That
against the Chatti may have been merely
a demonstration, like that mentioned in
c. 7. 1, to keep them from assisting their
neighbours ; the attack on the Marsi prob-
ably took the same direction as that des-
cribed in 1. 50, and was similarly intended

, merely to restore the morale o'f the troops.

The recovery of the eagle appears to have
been incidental.

18. aquilam. One eagle had been re-
gained the year before (1. 60, 4), and the
third is stated to have been recovered
from the Chatti in the first year of Clau·
