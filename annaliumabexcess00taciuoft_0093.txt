CONSTITUTION OF THE EARLF PRINCIPA TE. 75

   

Notwithstanding these powers, the early ‘princeps’ has no such
monarchy as that of Diocletian or Constantine; nor, on the other hand,
does the principate follow the democratic lines traced by the dictator
Caesar, whose memory Augustan literature seems to have been instructed
rather to obliterate than to glorify ¹.

ᾗ, The popular assemblies‚ suspended by the triumviri, restored, but
Ῑ gradually controlled by Augustus²‚ are practically abolished at his deathss,
Ξ From this time, whatever share they may have retained in the forms of
= legislation⁴, their most important function, that of electing the magistrates

of the state, survives at most in the plebiscite‚ following a ‘ senatus-con· ἕ
sultum‚' by which tribunitian power is conferred. on the princeps or his'v

associate ⁵; and, in other elections, m a mere formal‘ renuntiatio 'of the}
choice made by the senate⁵. The importance of this change is only
paralleled by the ease with which it appears to have been effected. gs
While the people thus eease to be an element of the constitution, the
Caesars have made their peace with the aristocracy‚ andin outward form
share a du-§LQIQQ Ἠρξ- it. There are two §ets ma istrates3 on
