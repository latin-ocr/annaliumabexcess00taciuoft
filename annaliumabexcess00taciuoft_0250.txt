legions lost with Varus. See Introd. vii.

ductum inde agmen, etc. Pfitzner
(p. 89) supposes the force of Stertinius
alone to be here meant, and that Ger-
manicus with the main body moved up
the right bank of the Ems, entering the
Osning district (see next note) from the
north. But the whole passage seems to
show that the ‘agmen’ is the army, and
the force of Stertinius only its advanced

guard. This district between the Ems
, and Lipp με. Westphalia between

Miinster and Paderborn, will thus appear
to have been reached by a most circuitous
1·;oute and the Germany military criticism‚
cited by Pfitzner‚ that no adequate stra-
tegie advantage from the sea- voyage is
perceptible, seems sully justified.

Teutoburgiensi saltu. The name
is given only here; and the other accounts
of the disaster (Vell. 2. 1183 Dio. 56.
20—22) do not help to identify the lo-
cality, which must have spread over con-
siderable space, as the final catastrophe
took place on the fourth day of the re-
treat. The marshy tract between Beckum
and the Lippe, preferred by N ipp. on the
ground of its suitability to the descrip-
tion, appears to lie too far west, and too
near to the country known to the Romans.
The district generally identified with this
forest is the Osning, extending, near the
sources of the Ems and Lippe, between
Paderborn and Osnaburg; and Varus is

Tiberius once had a winter camp ‘ad

7. occulta saltuum, on this genitive,

and ‘umido paludumss see Introd. v.
ὃ ἱὶιιιεε et aggeres, these are coupled
again in 4. 73, 2. On the former, see
note on c. 63, 6; the latter appear here,
and in 2. 7, 5, to be roads roughly con-
structed by embankment.

ative of place only here and ¹4· 15, 63

of‘ maestus' is frequent in poetry. Taci- ο

tus uses another such figure (⁶ tacentes
loci ’)in H. 3. 84, 6. The plural‘ loci:
used rather of distinct spots than of local-
ities (cp. 13. 36, 1), is rare, but in Sall.
and Liv. as well as in poets.

visu, ‘the actual appearance,' as
opposed to the associations (‘ memoria ’).

prima . . . castra.. It is noticed
that the order of description follows that
of the retreat os Varus. This may prob-
ably have been adopted for pictorial
effect; as the advance of Germanicus
would naturally be in the reverse direc-
tion (see note on c. 60, 5), and it is hardly

possible to suppose, as Nipp. suggests, .
that he altered his route, so as to follow ζ
the events in their order. Details of the j
march and encampments of Varus are '

of his narrative, occupying at least a page

central space, from the measurement of
which that of the whole camp was taken, ,

containing the ‘praetorium‚’ ‘augurale‚'
etc.,‘and sufficient space to collect the
troops for an address (c. 67, 1, ete.). This

camp, besides having a wide circuit (‘lato ⁵
ambitu’)‚ had this space regularly marked ’-
out, on a scale suitable to the whole

force.
