PREFACE.

THE text of this edition is that of Halm (Leipzig,
1877), which has been departed from in only a few
places for reasons stated in each case in the notes 1.
His readings differ but little from those of the last
edition of Orelli (18 59); both these texts being on the
whole nearer to the manuscript than that of Nipperdey
(1879), who in his turn is more conservative than
Ritter (1864). ’

Halm's orthography‚ closely following that of the first
Medicean MS„ has been retained, even where the same
word is not uniformly spelt, and the punctuation, except
in a few instances, also follows his. As his edition may
. be presumed to be in the hands of every reader of
Tacitus who desires to have a separate text, his ‘Com-
mentarius Criticus' may be here generally referred to
for all such matters of textual criticism as I have not
discussed or noticed.

The sections into which the chapters are subdivided
will be familiar to those acquainted with the Oxford
text (Parker, 1869): they have been also specified in all
references to other parts of Tacitus; which will, it is
hoped‚ greatly lessen trouble in consulting them ².

It is hardly necessary to state that the whole com-
mentary has been mainly drawn up from the abundant
material collected by so many predecessors, among the
earlier of whom those most used have been Walther
