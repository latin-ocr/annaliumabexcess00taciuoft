'³:- remains of those who fell with Varus ¹, or at best barren victories in the

ἑ] on Gaul ⁴, was recalled from an all but completed conquest ⁵. 0

The general foreign policy of such a ruler naturally finds little favourr
’ΤΞ with a historian who looked back with fondness to the military glories of
Ξ the old republic ⁶, and was writing when the star of conquest was again

-in the ascendant, when the eagles had advanced to the Carpathians and
the Pruth, the fleet to the Persian gulf and the Indian Ocean. Hisl
disdain is natural for the old ‘ narrow limits of empire ⁷‚’ for the ‘ timid
{2 or envious' advice of Augustus ⁸, and sor a prince who ‘cared not to
’Ξ extend the frontier‚’ and under whom ‘peace was slightly if at all dis-
Ξ turbed ⁹! Yet this ροῙίςῨ,ι while prudent and consistent, was not undig-

’ξ nified. The civil war ofluaxminius and Maroboduus¹⁰ fully attests the

⁴ wisdom of leaving Germany to its internal conflicts ¹¹. The anxiety to
preserve order ¹², and to settle difficulties without recourse to arms ¹³, will
commend itself no less than the just partition of Thrace under its own
ἔ princes ¹⁴ ; the acquisition of Cappadocia with advantage both to its own
‘i inhabitants and to the Roman people ¹⁵ ; and the maintenance of prestige
- in the East without open breach with Parthia; while Armenia is secured
ξ to the Roman interest through a prince of Roman sympathies, yet not
,ξ too Roman for his subjects ¹⁶.
Γ, Again, the severe punishment of governors for extortion will be
ζ ⁴ generally held deserving of more praise than is awarded by the historian‚
Ι, ,Ξ who, even when candidly admitting a case of proved guilt in this respect,
ζ). appears to lay 110 stress upon it ¹⁷. Nor can we share his apparent regret
thatlargess was not lavished on the needy descendant of the Hortensii ¹⁸3
fffithe more so as it is admitted that Tiberius cared not, at least at this time, -
’ω enrich himself¹⁹, or to be sparing of bounty to persons ²⁰ or communi—
’ ” ties* on just occasion.
ν· Again‚ when all his resources were strained to seed the people ²², we
§houd hardly blame the economy, even if we are allowed to imagine no
’ὴν ’ ,¹³ ’ motive, from which their mere amusements were curtailed ²³.
