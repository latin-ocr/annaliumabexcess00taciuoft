1. cappadoces: ep. c. 42, 6.

Q.. VeranIum. He was legatus of
Germanicus and one of the accusers of
Piso (3. 10, 2: 13, 33 19, 1). Some
identify him with the consul of 802, A.D.
49 (1 2. 5, 1), afterwards legatus of Britain
(14. 29, 1 ;
probably have been his son.

legatum accepere. He appears
only to have organized the province and
at once returned (c. 74, 2). Cappadocia
became a Caesarian province under a
procurator (ἱππεῖ ἐπετράπη), Dio, 57. 17,
7: cp. 12. 49, 1 3 Suet. Vesp. 8.

3. speraretur, sc. ‘ fore: ’ cp. 3. 8, 13
6. 41, 2, where Nipp. cites ‘superos
sperare secundos’ (Luc. 7, 349); ‘quem
. . . adiutorem speraverat ’ (Suet. Aug. 10).

commagenis: see on c. 42: νῦν δ’
ἐπαρχία γέγονε (Strab. 16. 2, 3, p. 749).

Q.. Servaeus. This name is re-
stored by Lips. from 3. 13, 3; 6. 7, 23
for the MS. ‘serva eius.’ The first of
these passages shows that he also was not
a permanent governor.

4. ad ius praetoris, i. e. to the juris-
diction of the ‘legatus Augusti pro rae-
tore' of Syria. In 791, A.D. 38, aius
again set up a king of Commagene,
Antiochus ΙΙΙ. (Dio, 59. 8, 2); and it
was again taken under Roman govern-

' ment, apparently united with Syria, by
Vespasian (Suet. Vesp. 8) : see Marquardt,
Staatsv. i. p. 240. The dominion of
Philopator of Cilicia (cp. c. 42, 7), which
is not here mentioned, was also probably
annexed to Syria.

5. socialia. This neuter appears to be
here alone used for ‘ res sociales? The idea
contained in the whole sentence is subject
of ⁴ habebant: ’ cp. Introd. v. ξ 65 b, 2.

laetum . . . habebant, ‘did not =
kee him pleased:’ cp. c. 65, 13 also ·

7. filium, M. Piso: see e. 76, 2, etc.
utrumque, i. e. he had sent only a ,

legatus of lower rank in charge of thern.

8. cyrri. Cyrrus, now Choros‚ gave
its name to Cyrrestica, the northern di-
vision os Syria. It lay on the chief road
connecting Antioch with the bridge over
the Euphrates at Zeugma.

decumae legionis: see Introd. vii. p. ,
104.

10. ut. rettuli: cp. c. 55, 3.

11. intendere ε cp. c. 38, 6.

12. filios. One of the sons had re· 2
mained in Rome (3. 16, 5), but may have Α
been accused os intrig'uing there. That ¹
the proceedings of Germanicus were ¹
watched and reported at home, would ’
appear from c. 59. ζ

13. paucis familiariumadmbitis. The j L
same e ression is repeated in 3. 10, 6, t ,1
osan in ormal board os assessors. Here ι
they are only witnesses. ¹ J

14. ira et dissimulatio, ‘resentrnent Ἴ
struggling against disguise,’ i.e. partially, ,l
but not wholly dissembled: cp. ‘amore ,
et ira ' 13. 44, 6.

15. contumacibus, ‘insolent‚’i.e. ‘iron- J „s
ical entreaties.' ' ³:

discesserunt. The MS. has ‘disces-5 ,.
