28, 2.

1. exuta aequalitate. This phrase 1s
used in 3. 26. 3, of those who seek pre-
eminence, as here of those who accept a
position of inferiority. The application
of the word to political equality (ἰσοτιμία)
appears to be peculiar to Tacitus. see 3.
74, 63 H. 2. 3S,2

2. seque et. This poetical combina-
tion of conjunctions is found' 111 some ten
places in Tacitus (Dr. ξ 123). On the
following use of ⁸ et’ sor 6 etiam? see
Id. ξ 108.
2. 71, 1.

5. in cassum, ‘id1y,' as mere decla·
mation.

disserere often takes the accusative in
Tacitus (2. 27, 1; 6. 34 5, etc.‚) as
also in Sall. (Cat.5 „9) without the re-
striction, usual ln Cicero, to the accus. of
pronouns, or of adjectives expressing
amount, as ‘,pauca’ ‘,’multa etc. See
Nipp

bellum, i.e. such a military insur-
rection as was in fact imminent.

7. differebant This is explained
as equivalent to‘ varios rumores differe-
bant de principibus’ (Gerb. and Greef,
Lex.); but the verb, when used with
accus. pers.. as in old poets and Pro-
pertius, appears to modify its ordinary
sense of divulgare, as found with acc.
rei (3. 12, 7; 4. 25, 5, etc) to one more
akin to t'he force of ‘distrahi fama’ (3.
10, 5). Cp. the analogous uses of‘ dif-
famare aliquem' (c. 72, 4, etc.) and

‘aliquid' (14. 22, 5).
8. experientia.. This sense of‘ know·

‘Aderat finis’ is repeated,

ledge gained by practice‚’ is valmost wholly

Vergilian (G. 1. 4, etc.) and Tacitean (as

c. 46, 2, etc.).

moli parem: so ‘par negotiis‚’ 3. ἕ
‘Moles' of weight

30, 5; 6. 39, 3, ete.
of empire, c. 11, 2.

Neronem. This name, though still Ξ

used here and 111 c. 5, 6, was dropped on

his adoption. See Introd. ix. note 283 .=

and, on his age an‘d services, Id. viii.
PP-1142115-

10. superbia. This characteristic of the
Claudii 15 repeatedly insisted on by Livy,
(e. g. 2. 56), whom Suet. has followed
(Tib. 2). For the arguments by which

it 15 maintained that the traditionayl policy 3

of this family has been misconceived, see f

Mommsen, Hist. of Rome, vol. i. Ap- ³

pendix.

11. et. This would naturally· be fol· Ξ
lowed by another 'et’ or ‘neque‚' but 3
the construction, besides the change of ji

subject in ‘ congestos,’ etc„ is varied by ²,

the introduction of a climax with‘ ne.
quidem! ‘Regnatrix’ is ἅπ. εἰρ., used{

invidiously of the‘ domus principis? On ῖ

the fondness of Tacitus for such verbali
substantives‚ see Introd. v. 569.

prima ab infantia, etc. On the
events of the early life of Tiberius, see
Introd. viii. pp. 112, etc. He had only
held two consulships‚ at the age of 29
and 35; and his triumphal honours are
maintaiiied by himself and his partisans
(see 3. 47, 5, and note there) to have
been far below what he could have
claimed. Tacitus, it should be observed,
is not here speaking' m hismwn person.

1,3. exul: so most edd. after Muretus, ²

giving ‘’agere the force of‘ degeress '‘S-³
