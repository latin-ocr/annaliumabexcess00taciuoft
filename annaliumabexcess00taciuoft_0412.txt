Blaesus specie recusantis, sed neque eadem adseveratione, et con-
sensu adulantium haud adiutus est.

36. Exim promptum quod multorum intimis questibus tege· 1

at home.' ‘ Meminissent ’ answers to an
imperfect, as ‘ memini ’ to a present.

3. principibus, ‘members of the im-
perial family:’ cp. e. 6, 5, etc.

5. Illyricum: cp. 1. 24, 1 ; 2. 44, ι ;

2. 84, 1, etc.) were a family beyond that
of Augustus or Tiberius, or of other
members of the house, except Germa-
nicus.

8. elusa. est, ‘was parriedz’ cp. ‘re-
fellere aut eludere ’ (c. 67, 2) and other
similar uses, as 14. 41, 2; H. 1. 26, 3.
The above reading is adopted by Halm,
after Freinsh„ for the MS. ‘elusa. et,'
which is retained by Orelli and Nipp.,
⁶ et ’ being placed at the beginning of the
next chapter. The reading 'interfectus-
que . et,' in 6. 18,1, has been similarly
corrected, after Bezzenberger: it being
supposed that the insertion of such a dot
is intended by an old reviser of the MS.
to indicate an error (Pfitzner, p. 18).

9. Proximo senatus die: so Halm
and Nipp., aster Freinsh, for the MS.

‘proximi, 'from comparison of 2. 33, 15
50, 3. Tiberi us here gives an answer to
the recent decree (c. 32, 3).

10. cuncta curarum. On the genitive,

13. aetatem, i. e. that· their youth made ⁷

14. nubilem filiam, i. e. that he had
to arrange a marriage for her. It is

thought by Borghesi that she was the Le· ‘

17. haud adiutus est.soHa1m; the
MS. has‘ haut iustusss with a marginal
correction* auditus: whence J. F. Gron.

reads‘ adiutus: with the meaning that '
the flatterers of Blaesus supported his ε
candidature. A correction departing less ‘f

from the MS. text is that of Jac. Gron„
adopted by Orelli and Nipp., ‘haut iutus

est; this participle being found in the
MS, and retained by most editors, in 14.
4, 1. Either this or the reading above ‘fif

given would mean that the flatterers of

Blaesus unanimously refrained from sup· .

porting‚ or rather overruled, his insincere
objections.
18. promptum = ‘ prolatum est: ’

cp.'

‘promere' inl. 6, 8, etc.; here m contrast ’

to ‘quod. .tegebatu’r,’ ‘a grievance
stifled in the whispered murmurs of
many!
