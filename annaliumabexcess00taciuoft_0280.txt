1. partemque prolis. Strabo (16. 1,
28, 748) states that he sent four sons,
Seraspadanes, Rhodaspis, Phraates, and
Vonones, with two wives and four sons
belonging to them. In Mon. Anc. vi. 3,
these are described as ‘filios suos nepo-
tesque omnes? The two first names are
given in an inscription (Orelli 628). This
surrender was made to M. Titius (St‘rabo,
1.1.) who was legatus of Syria between
743 and 747, B.C. ¹1·.7 (Rawlinson‚ p.
211).

firmandae amicitiae. On this dative
with ‘mittere' cp. 1. 60, 2.

2. haud perinde . . . quam: cp. c. ξ,
3, etc.; also without a negative in 4. 20,
6; 6. 30, 4, ete., and in Suet. The same
reason for this action of Phraates is given
by Strabo (l. l.) δεδιὼς τὰς στάσεις καὶ
τοὺς ἐπιθεμένους αὐτῷ. Cp. Mon. Anc.
(l. l.) ‘non bello superatus, sed amicitiam
nostram per [liberorum] suorum pignora
petens.’ It would thus appear that ⁸ obses
datus,' above, is not to be taken strictly.

3. Post finem. etc. Phraataces, a
natural son of Phraates, murdered his
father and succeeded him, and was him-
self forced to give way to Orodes also an
Arsacid‚ who was assassinated by his sub—
jects (Jos. Ant. 18. 2, 4). Phraataces was
king as early as August B.C. 2, and fiad
an interview with Gaius Caesar in the
East: see Dio, 55. 10, a, 4 (Dindorf):
cp. Vell. 2. 101, 2. His coins date to
A. D. 4; and the assassination of Orodes
appears to have taken place in A.D. 7 or
8, in the latter of which years the coinage
of Vonones begins. He may have been
sent for earlier, as we hear of a Parthian
embassy to Rome apparently in 758 or
759. A.D. 5 or 6 (Suet. Tib. 16).

internas, ‘ domestic.' So used of ‘dis-

cordiae' (c. 26, 3), ‘certamina’ (c. 54,
2), etc.‚ and domestic affairs generally

(442313riin01-1bus, more properly called
‘megistanes’ (‘mehestan )‚ 15. 27, 4;
Suet. Cal. 5.

5. vetustissimum. Of the others,
Phraates was certainly alive (6. 31, 4) ; so
that either Strabo (1. l.), who places Vo-
nones last, may not give a correct order
of seniority‚ or Josephus (1. l.) may be
{Ighft-¹ tin saying that he was selected as

e test.

6. Caesar. Augustus, who has been
mentioned (c. 1, 2), is intended by this
name here and in c. 3.

auxit, ‘enriched him:' cp. ‘nomini-
bus auxit’ 1. 3, 15 ‘ornat Phraaten’ 6.

ὃ laetantes . . . ad: so ‘laeto milite
ad mutationem ducum' H. 2. 36, 4. This
mode of expressing relation is frequent in
Tacitus with adjectives or participles, e.g.
¹· 3?’.{12‚⁴33.⁵5.{·..⁷’ ‘”T’hff’ssaffianfz’ ‘3:21
made to speak of their empire as a world
in itself, as the Romans would speak of
‘noster orbis’ (G. 2, ῐ; Agr. 12, 3) or
ἡ οἰκουμένη (Luke 2, 1, etc.). Α

10. trucidantium . . . exturbantiuff
used aoxi=tically2 see Introd. v. ὅ 54.
On the defeat and death of Crassus in
701, B.C. 53, see Plut. Crass. 27-31, 560-
563; Dio, 40. 16-27‚ etc.; on that of
Antonius, see above, c. 1, 2.

12. accendebat: cp. ‘incendebat’ 1.
2 3, 1, etc. ‘ Dedignor’ is chiefly poetieal,
and elsewhere in Tacitus is followed by
an infin. (c. 34, 8, etc.) or accus. (14. 46,
2 .
