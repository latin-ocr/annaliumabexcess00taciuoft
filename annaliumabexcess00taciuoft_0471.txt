Illyricum ⁹ (C. Ι. L. iii. 1741) or ‘mariti-
2. ma pars Illyrici’ (Vell. 2. 125, 5). Its
northern boundary towards Pannonia is not
clearly marked (cp. 1. 16, 1); in other
directions it extended to Moesia (see on
1. 80, 1) and Epirus (2. 53, 1), and thus
included modern Dalmatia, Bosnia, Her-
ovina. and M ontenegro‚ its chief town
being Salonae. The name ‘Illyricum ’ in
the widest sense, included Pannonia and
even Moesia (Suet. Tib. 16: see Mar-
quardt, Staatsv. i. p. ¹41)-

6. 21, 4; once in Sall. (Fr. H. 2. 1 D, 1 K,

On the variations in the number of these
cohorts, see Introd. vii. p. 107. On the
fourth urban cohort at Lugdunum, see 3.
41, 2. 1t is to be observed that in this
survey Tacitus makes no mention of the
‘ cohortes civium Romanorum ’ (cp. 1. 8,
3), nor of the ‘vigiles' at Rome, who
were hardly regular soldiers and mostly
fieedmen.

transmarine colonies. Nipp. notes that
the districts thus described as the recruit-

the Transpadana, and the Greek cities of
South Italy. All Italians became eligible
