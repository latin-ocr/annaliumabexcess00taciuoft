osse at Rome), or after the expulsion of
kings (as he appears to think was mostly

moes it to anarchy consequent on the

nob-mle which had overthrown the

wuomrchies.

6. Romulus. Other traditious (as
liv. 1. 8) and jur-ists (Pomp. Dig. 1. 2, 1)
hue imagined Romulus also as a law·
&a A collection of ‘leges regiae ’ had

made, under the title of ‘ius Pa·

' um,' at an uncertain date (Dion.

3. 36), on which Granius Flaccus

ι hd written a commentary at the time of

Julius Caesar (Dig. 50. 16, 144). Both
are now lost.

8. a ¹1·qu et Anco. A law of the
former is referred to in 12. 8, 23 the
latter is credited with democratic ten-
dencies by Vergil (Aen. 6, 816), which
may‘ffiplresexlilt a tradition of popular laws
ascn o 1m.

9. praecipuus . . . sanctor: cp. ⁸ prae-
cipuus . . . auctor‘ c. 55, 5. ‘Sanctor’
is apparently a word invented by Tacitus
(Introd. v. ξ 69) and is ἅπ. dp.

1 1. multa populus paravit. By ‘popu-
lus‚’ Tacitus appears here to mean the
πολῖται, or body politic in general, without
distinguishing ‘ populus' and ‘ plebs.’
He would refer no doubt to such enact-
ments as those which established the
republican constitution and enlarged the
senate (Liv. 2. 1), and to the ‘leges
Valeriae' of 245, Β. c. 509 (Id. c. 8),
passed against such ‘patrum faetionoe‘
as desired to restore the kings. It is
more doubtful whether he means to speak
in the same unqualified praise of the ‘lex
sacrata’ instituting the tribunate (Id.
c. 33), or the ‘lex Publilia' giving the
electiou of plebeian magistrates to the
tribes (Id. c. 57); though these may be
regarded as carried against ‘patrum sac-
tiones‚' i. e. against an extreme section of
that body.

12. creati . . . decemviri: see Liv. 3.
33-57: cp. also Mommsen (Hist. B. ii.
eh. 2, p. 290), who shows that the appa-
rent design in this movement was to

limitation of the consular powers by
written law. A good general sketch of
