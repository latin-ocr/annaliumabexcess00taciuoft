basilicam Pauli. From what is
said below, Lepidus appears to have been
grandson of L. Aemilius Paulus, cos. 704,
Β. 0. 50, who was at once the restorer of
the old Basilica Aemilia or Fulvia ad-
joining the Forum, and the founder of
the new and magnificent Basilica Pauli
(Cic. Att. 4. 16, 143 Plut. Caes. 29; App.
B. C. 2. 26), which was completed and
dedicated by his son Paulus Aemilius
Ι ep idus, the husband of Cornelia, in his
consulship (as cos. suff) in 720, Β. c. 34
gDio, 49. 42, 2), and was again restored
in his name by Augustus and others after
a fire in 740, B. c. 14 (Dio, 54. 24, 3).
Its columns of Phr) gian marble are noted
by Pliny(N. H. 36. 15, 24 ,.ιο2) It ap-
pears probable (see Burn,p .88) that the
new basilica adjoined the old one on the
south· eastern side, and eclipsed or ab·
sorbed it, as one only. the‘ belligeri sub·
limis regia Paulli' (Stat. Sylv. 1. 1, 30),
is mentioned by authors.

11. etiamtum. In the time of Tacitus
himself all such acts were those of the

publica, towards the state.

nec Augustus arcuerat. He is re-
presented by Velleius (2. 89, 4) and
Suetonius (Aug. 29) as even stimulating
men to such acts of munificence. Sue—
tonius instances the same three persons
who are here mentioned. ‘Arcuerat' is
read by most edd. (after Li ps) for the
MS. ‘arguerat;’ the use of this verb with
inf„ though elsewhere apparently con-
fined to poem, being analogous to such as
are noted ιιι Introd. v. ξ 43.
