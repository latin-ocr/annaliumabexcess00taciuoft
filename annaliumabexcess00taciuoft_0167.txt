NOTES. S TEM B. 149

31. Β (5). Germanicus is known only by his adoptive name, as

· ‘Germanicus Caesar;’ once apparently (see Henzen, p. 60) as ‘ Ger-

manicus Iulius Caesar.² There is no record of his praenomen, or of
any original cognomen. The date of his birth is given as established
by Mommsen (see above, note 8). In life, he bears the titles quaestor
(760, Aa). 7, Suet. Cal. 1), augur, flamen Augustalis (see on 2. 83, 2),
Cos. ii (765, 771, Λα). 12, 18), Imp. ii (see on 1. 58, 8): see Orelli
655, 660, etc. On the further honours decreed athis death, see 2. 83,
and notes.

32. B (6). The name is always given as ‘Livia' by Tacitus and in
inscriptions (e.g. Orell. 653, 1724, 2846, etc.), but by Suet. (Cl. 1),
and Dio (57. 22, 2, etc.) as ‘Livilla.' Her first marriage to C. Caesar
is mentioned in 4. 40, 5; her complicity in the murder of Drusus in
4. 3, 3, etc.; her death, in Dio, 58. 11, 7. On the question whether
she was ever betrothed to Seianus, see note on 4. 40, 11.

33. B (7). The original names of Claudius are given in Suet. Cl. 2,
and in several inscriptions. His titles, prior to his principate‚ are those
of augur, sodalis Augustalis (1. 54, 2), sodalis Titius, consul (suff. 790,
Αω. 37, Suet. Cl. 7): he had also previously received ‘ ornamenta con-
sularia' (Suet. Cl. 5): see Henzen 5399, etc. As princeps, he is the
first who assumed the name of ‘Caesar' as an imperial cognomen,
without ever having been adopted into the family; but, unlike his pre·
deoessors, he always retains his gentile name, and is generally known
by it3 his full name being ‘Ti. Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus!
It may be noted that he accepted the ‘ nomen imperatoris' no less than
twenty-seven times (Insc. on the Aqua Claudia, Porta Maggiore, Rome,
Orelli 54). He was betrothed in youth to Aemilia Lepida (A. 12), and
to Medullina (Orell. 716), besides contracting the four marriages here
given 3 on all of which, and on his children by the first three, see Suet.
Cl. 26, 27.

at the instigation of Messalina, 13. 32, 5 3 43, 33 Dio, 60. 18, 4: on

- her alleged betrothal to Seianus, see note on 4. 40, 11 3 6. 27, 1.

35. Β (9, 10). On the date of birth and names of the twin sons of
Drusus, see note on 2. 84, 1. Young Tiberius was named in his grand- -
father's will j0int-heir with Gaius (Suet. Tib. 76), who adopted him and
caused him to be entitled princeps iuventutis (Suet. Cal. 15), but soon
afterwards put him to death (Id. 23). ⁹

36. B (11). On the projected marriage between the daughter of

s Seianus and young Drusus, see note on 3. 29, 53 on his death, Suet. Cl.
