THE SPNTAX AND STVLE' OF TACJTUS. 51

clause, without the addition of magis, as quanto inopina, tanto
maiora 1. 68, 5. Cp. 1. 57, 13 3. 5‚4; 46,4; 4. 48,5; 6. 21, 4;
ς 45, 2 ; 12. 11, 2. Sometimes comparative and positive are j0ined, as
=· 2. 5, 23 3. 43, 1.

(3) By the omission of tanto in the apodosis, as quanto in-
cautius efferverat, poenitentia patiens 1. 74, 73 cp. 1. 2, 1 ; 4. 69, 4;
6. 19, 53 26, 3. In 3. 8, 1, tam is similarly omitted. The rule of
‘Nipp. (on 1. 68, see also Roby 1205), that in all such cases the clause
so marked is to be taken absolutely, seems hardly to be established.
Dr. ξ 183.

With these usages may be compared the abbreviation of adversative
sentences by using, after non modo, either sed without etiam, as 1. 60,

. 1, etc.; or etiam (or quoque) without sed, as 3. 19, 23 4. 35, 1. This
usage is found also in Livy. Dr. ξ 128.

 

65. 'Phe omission of coniunctionis (asyndeton) is very frequent,
either in lively narrative, as inserunt. . . offerunt. . . intendunt 1. 28, 5 (cp.
41, 4 ; 64, 1 ; 70, 4, etc.); or in enumerations‚ as senatus magistratuum
legum 1. 2, 15 pellerent pellerentur 6. 35, 2 (cp. 1. 3, 53 35, 1; 60, 3,
etc.) 3 or in summing up, as legiones provincias classes, cuncta 1. 9, 6
(cp. 1. 68, 7; 12. 65, 4, etc.); or to point a climax, as manu voce vul-
nere 2. 17, 5, sanie odore contactu 4. 49, 4; tempus preces satias 6.
38, 1, etc.; or an antithesis, as lacrimas gaudium questus adulationem

’ 1. 7, 2 (cp. 4. 49, 3; 60, 3; 6. 19, 33 15. 27, 4, etc.). Such asyndeta
are more or less common in rhetorical writings, as in the orations of
Cicero, in Sallust, Livy, etc. See Ritt. on 11. 6, Nipp. on 4. 43; 12. 19;
and a full account in Dr. ἕξ 133-138.

66. Tacitus adopts from Livy, but employs oftener, the concise Greek
uae of adver-bs as attributive adjectivae, as circum„ 4. 55, 8, etc.;
superne. ..cominus 2. 20, 3, etc. Dr. § 23, Madv. 301 c, Obs. 2.

>32 67. 'Phe nequent use of tamquam, quasi, and velut, in ex-
pressions of the alleged or imagined reason or purpose of an aet,
ᾗ, like that of ὡς with participles or prepositions (see L. and S. Lex. s.V.
C. 1. 11), has been very fully analysed by Wolfflin and others <see
[332 below). It would appear that the distinctions which some have attempted
'‘2to draw between the force of these words can hardly be sustained; that
the question of reality or pretence is on the whole left open, though the
latter view is not unfrequently suggested by tamquam, and still oftener
by quasi or velut ; and that the chief distinction between the two latter is ,
that velut is preferred in the earlier writings, quasi in the Annals. On
3the use of tamquam, cp. 1.12, 6; 2. 84, 33 12. 39, 53 13. 43, 83 14.
