literature, our only contemporary accounts of the time of Tiberius are
contained in one or two passages of Valerius Maximus ¹, and in the
‘work of M. Velleius *Paterculus, who, besides ‘Ediisi'derable notice of
,the earlier li'fe of 'Tiberius gives, in the last nine chapters, a slight
sketch, without any regular narrative, of the first sixteen years of his
principate ², published in 783, Aa). 30, and dedicated to M. Vinicius,
then one of the consuls ⁸. v.

If any others published‚ during the lifetime of Tiberius, any account
of his government, their names as well as their writings are lost to us;
but some works produced soon afterwards are on record: amongst
which a stock of material, of most questionable value‚ is contributed
by the imperial family itself.
⁷ Tiberius himself composed a brief summary of his life ⁴, which, like

that of Augustus, may probably have been appended to his will, and
5 intended sor inscription on his tomb. It must, however, have lacked
>3 the skill* of the famous ‘Marmor Ancyranum,’ for our solitary reference
J to it cites it only as containing aglaring and audacious falsehood ⁵.
² The memoirs of the younger Agrippina have been.already mentioned.
ξ We have also a stray reference to them in Pliny the Elder⁶, but by the
,Ξῆ time of Tacitus they seem to be a forgotten book ⁷. It is impossible
{— to estimate how far they had already done their work by influencing
ξ intermediate writers, or how much of the court scandal, in which
Ξ Suetonius revels, and which even Tacitus does not always disdain‚
Ξ flowed originally from this polluted source.
= Claudius is also recorded to have written an autobiography in
eight books, ‘magis inepte quam ineleganter;' and a general history
stom the close of the civil wars, of which two books were written in
his youth, at the suggestion of Livy and with the assistance of Sulpicius
Ξ Flavus, and the remaining forty—one books during his princip'ate⁸. It
Ξ is not known whether it extended beyond the lifetime of Augustus,
ἶ, though the apparent length of the work may make it probable.
⁴ Turning from these to more neutral authorities, we find first in date
' the name o'f M. Seneca the rhetor, whose history, from the beginning
of the civil wars to the last days of his own life, would seem, from ant
Ξ expressih used by his son, to be intended as a corrective of prevalent
