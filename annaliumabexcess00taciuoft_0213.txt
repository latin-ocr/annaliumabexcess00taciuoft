5. egredi tentoria. The active use
of this verb originates with Caesar and
Livy. Tacitus uses it also thus meta-
phorically, as ‘egredi relationem' (2. 38,
3); ‘neque . . . praeturam egressa‘ (3.
, 2).
3⁰congregari. Ritter’s repetition of
‘non’ before this word receives support
ftom H. 4. 33, 25 Dial. 23, 33 but it is
not impossible that Tacitus may have
omitted it here, as having an ill sound
. before ‘ oon,'. though such a juxtaposition
js sometimes tolerated by him (2. 55, 2).

, finum. ln several passages of Cicero

*passas into t of ‘without a purpose ;‘
whence by another step, the word
eomes to mean ‘without cause ¹ or ⁸ rea·

This word is almost2
confined to Livy and Tacitus, and here ⁴
only (acc. to Drager) used without a geni· ·

58, 1 ; 6. 6, 2, and in several other places
in Tacitus (see Nipp.)‚ as also often in
Quintilian.

8. hebescere, ‘grew dull! This word,
like ‘languescere' in c. 28, 1, is nowhere
else used osan eclipse. The figure may
perhaps have been suggested by the ¹ stel—
lis acies obtusa videtur’ of Vergil (G. 1,
3 5)-

910. piaculo, ‘ from guilt.‘ This mean-
ing is found in old writers, also in Vergil
(Aen. 6, 569), and Livy (5. 52, 8). Ta-
citus does not elsewhere use it in this
sense.

11. epistulas. This use of the plural,
as in c. 36, 45 2. 70, 32 78, 1; and many
other places (see Nipp.)‚ is peculiar to
this age, but probably suggested, as
Nipp. notes, by the classical use of ‘lit—
erae,’ which has this meaning in the
plural only.

12. desolatus, 'iso :’ so ⁸ filia . . .

MS. form, which is found in Eun. ap.
Gell. 4. 7 ⁸ qui propter Hannibalis copias
considerant? Such archaic forms are not
unfrequently revived by Tacitus, who how—
ever uses elsewhere the ‘e' form of this
perfect (c. 61, 3, etc.).
