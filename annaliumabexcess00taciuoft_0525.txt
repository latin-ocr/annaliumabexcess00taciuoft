prominence.

Ilienses: see note on 2. 54, 3. Here,
as there, the name is restored from the
context, the MS. having ‘ nellienses.’

8. Halicarnasii: so Halm and Nipp.
with Plin. N. H. (several places). Orelli
retains the MS. ‘Alicarnasii‚’ the old edi·
tions generally read Halicarnassii. This
once famous Carian city, on the site of
Budrum, appears never to have complete-
ly recovered its destruction by Alexander
(see Grote, >Hist. vol. xii. pp. 127-133),
and in later times to have retained cele-
brity only through its Mausoleum. An
inscription, however, has been found there,
dating as late as the time of Diocletian
(C. 1. L. iii. 1, 449).

mine et. ducentos per annos, i.e.
during their whole history: the number
is a round one, reckoned from the sup-
posed date of their foundation (see Nipp.'s
note). They were a colony from Troezen
(Hdt. 7. 99, 4), or, according to a later
version (Mela, 1. 16, 85), from Argos.

9. vivo in saxo, ¹ in natural rock ;' so
as to avoid the necessity of laying con-
crete: this expression appears to be
from Verg. Aen. 1, 167 : cp. Ov. F. 5, 661.
The chief buildings of the city were on a
rocky hill (Newton, Trav. and Disc. ii. 205).

eo ipso nitebantur, i.e. the fact by
which they supported their claim was con-
sidered even to make against it. It was
not thought well that two temples to Cae·
sars should be in the same city. On the
