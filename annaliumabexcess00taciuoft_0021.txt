LIFE AND WORKS OF TACITUS. 3

afterwards to extend, selected him, a young man of from twenty-three
to twenty-five, as his son-in-law ¹. The rank, and the personal cha-
racter of Agricola, justify us in assuming, that the chosen husband of
his daughter would be a young man not only of moral excellence, but
of already assured position and promise.

Probably, *two years later, he entered the senate as quaestor ². By
the age of thift3·7s0ur or thirty· -six‚ he had attained, besides the praetor-

ι’, ship, a place among the ‘Quindecimviri sacris faciundisss’, ’one of the

old priestly collegeS, the members of which were generally men of good
rank and family.

Up to this time Tacitus may be assumed to have lived in Rome,
employed chiefly in the forensic practice, his eminence in which has
been described by Pliny3 perhaps also occupied in such literary work
as could be safely pursued, or in collecting material for greater things
in contemplation„

During the next sour years, from 842 to 846, A.D. 89 to 93, he was
absent from Rome 4, probably in some provincial command, or as
‘legatus legionis! It has been suggested, that at this time he may
have acquired such persona} knowledge as he shows· respecting the
German peoples.

The reign of terror during the last three years of Domitian, from
846 to 849, Aa). 93 to 96, he appears to describe as an eye-witness ⁵.
¹ Hitherto he must have been acceptable to the princes under whom

he had lived⁶; and even in these last years he appears, by his own
confession, to have shown no more courage or independence than the
'rest of the senate, with whom, in his sels-reproach, he identifies him-
self⁷; but the lasting influence on his mind of the memory of this

’ -period will be found traceable in all his writings‚ and strengthened‚

rather than weakened, by the force of time ⁸. It is hardly to be
wondered at, that one who had lived through such scenes should be
haunted through life by the spectre of Domitian.

In 850, A.D. 97, he attained consular rank, as ‘suffectus,' on the
death of Verginius Rufus, whose funeral eulogy he delivered ⁹. It is
sufficient 'evidence of his position, that he was chosen successor to
Verginius and colleague of Nerva.

In 853, Aa). 100, he was associated with Pliny in the prosecution,
