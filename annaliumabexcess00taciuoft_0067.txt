where a sentence with quod would be expected. One or two
such instances are found in Cicero, none in Caesar or Sallust. Livy has
several such, as degeneratum, perlitatum, tentatum, etc. So Tacitus
has nihil occultum 3. 9, 3, cuncta . . . composita 2. 57, 1, etc. For
l'the part. may stand a substantive (as 1. 19, 5 ; 33, 6), adjective (as
³ H. 3. 64, 1), or pronoun (as 6. 47, 4). Dr. § 211, Madv. 426, Obs. 1,

56. Many usages connected with these have been already noticed‚
such as their omission (ἐξ 5, 10, 12 c, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 3ο), and the
substitution of other expressions, where constructions with prepositions
would be usual (ἓξ 15, 18, 20, 33 e, 37). On the anastrophe of preps.,
see§ 78. See also Nipp. on 2. 683 and, for other usages not noticed
in the following sections, see Dr. ἐξ 80-105.

5⁷. Apud is used, never in the minor writings, rarely in the Histories,
and very often in the Annals, with the names of places and countries‚
or, analogously, with general names, where a simple locative, or the
ablative with in, would be usual, as apud urbem Nolam 1. 5, 5 ; Mi-
senum apud et Ravennam 4. 5, 13 apud Rh'odum 6. 20, 3; arae apud
quas 1. 61, 53 apud paludes 1. 64, 3. Α few instances are found in

earlier prose. Dr. ξ 82, Roby 1858, Nipp. on 1, 5, Gerber and Greef,
Lex. s.v.

58. Circa has the metaphorical meaning of ‘concerning,’ or ‘in⁷
relation to;’ as circa artes bonas 11. 15, 1 3 circa necem Gai Caesaris
,ιι 29, 1 3 circa scelera 16. 8, 3. This meaning appears to originate

with Seneca and Pliny mai„ and to be very frequent in Quintilian.
Dr. §86, Roby 1867.

59. Erga. has the sense of‘ against( or ‘in relation to,' as fastus J
-1 erga. ..epulas 2. 2, 53 erga Germanicum 2. 76, 3, fama erga .exitus
4. 11, 3; anxii erga Seianum 4. 74, 5, etc. These uses are very rare
3²-bef0re Tacitus, and very prominent in his works. Dr. § 98, Roby 193 1,
