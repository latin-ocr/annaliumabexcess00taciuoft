1. discordia, probably ⁸ turbulenee ι ’
cp. ‘discors' c. 38, 1, etc. Dio (56.
47, 2) states that one of the actors struck
for higher pay, and that the people sup-
ported him so enthusiastically that the
tribunes were forced on the same day to
convene the senate to authorise the in-
crease.

histrionum. This word <interchanged
with ‘mimus’ in c. 73, 2, 4) is gene-
rally applied by Tacitus (e. g. c. 77,
2, etc.) and writers of his age (e. g. Juv.
7, 90) to the ὀρχησταί, who, from the
time of Augustus (see Suet. Aug. 45, etc.)
are called ‘pantomimi’ The art of re-
presenting characters by dumb-show (de-
scribed as ⁸ saltare Agamemnona‚’ ‘ Oedi-
pum,‘ ‘Ledam‚’ etc.)‚ though in some
form as old as the earliest Italian drama
(see 4. 14, 4; Liv. 7. 2), received such
development at that time from Bathyllus,
Pylades, and Hylas, that they have been
called its inventors <Zosimus 1. 6). Some
description of it may be seen in Macrob.
2, 7; Lucian de Salt. c. 67, etc.

indulserat. Suetonius (Aug. 45) de-
scribes his interest in all public amuse—
ments‚ but adds that his indulgence to
the ‘histriones' was not untempered by
severity3 for Hylas and another were
scourged, and Pylades temporarily ban·
ished (see Dio, 54. 17, 4) by his order.

2. dum. See note on c. 2 3, 6.

3. Bathylli; he was a freedman and
f client of Maecenas, and the chief fiyal of
ἲ Pylades. See Dio, 54. 17, 4. Gla-'¹¹ ⁴

abhorrebat talibus studiis. Cp.
‘abhorruisse . . . oblectamentis’ 14. 21,
2. The case is probably in both in-
stances an abl. like ⁶ meta distabat
utraque’ (Ov. Met. 3, 145). The simple
abl. with verbs expressing difference is
rare and poetical; the simple dative
rather less rare: see Zumpt 468.

4. morum via, ‘ his character took a
difierent course.’ Cp. the use of ‘via’

alone. 4. 7, 1. On the character given of
Tiberius as ‘tristissimus hominum,’ see
Introd. viii. p. 117.

5. habitum, ⁴ held in hand? ‘ govemed :’
cp. ‘ Hispaniae . . . habebantur' 4. 5, 2 ;
⁶ corruptius habiti (liberti) ’ H. 1. 22, 1.

nondum audebat. It is stated by
Dio (57. 11, 5) that he was constantly
present at the regular public entertain-
ments during the earlier years of his rule.
Occasional treatS, such as gladiatorial
shows, became very rare under him. See

. 62, 3.

4 6. ad duriora, ‘to sterner coursesss-
‘ duris iudicibus' is used isi a good sense
(15. 55, 5). Cp. ‘dura virtus' G. 31, 5.

7. Druso Caesare Ο. Norbano.
‘Flaccus‚‘ the cognomen of the latter, is
given in Suet. Vit. 3, and in Fasti (Hen-
zen 6442), which also give M. Silanus as
cos, suff. Flaccus appears to have been
praetor in 764, A.D. 11 (Henzem Act.
Arv. Index, p. 192).

8. triumphus. This was not celebrated
till two years later. Cp. 2. 41. 2. Its
award seems to show that the insignificant
campaign described in c. 50, 51 had been
greatly overrated at Rome. See note on
c. 52, 1. On the reservation of the full
honours of a triumph, or of an ovation
(cp. 3. 11, 1) sor the imperial family, see
note on c. 72, 1.

8. manente bello. This was irregular,
though not without precedent. At the
time of the actual celebration of this
triumph, the war was held to be virtually
concluded: see 2. 41, 3. ⁹

9. initio veris et repentino . . . ex-
cursu. Nipp. has collected many in-
stances of the somewhat unusual, and
especially Tacitean, insertion of a con-
junction in such sentences. It is intended
here to indicate two distinct contrasts,
that of ‘in aestatem ' to ‘ initio veris‚' and
that of ‘ summa ope'to ‘ repentino'excursu.’

Chattos. This powerful tn'be, con-
