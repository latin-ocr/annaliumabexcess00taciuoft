252 CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A.U.C. 768.

have the force of ‘ etiarn. ·' ‘ which even

cohorts was usually present, and an at-
his father was said to have censured, as

tempt afterwards to dispense with it only

alarming to the people' (the ‘vilis san-
guis’ of Rome).

gbst6inuerit. On the tense, see on
c. 1, .

1. varie trahebant. On this sense of
‘ trahere,' cp. c. 62, 3.

alii . . . quidam, ‘abstinuisse dice·
bant’ is to be supplied.

2. tristitia. On his character, and
the contrast in this respect with Augustus,
see c. 54, 4, Suet. Aug. 45: Introd. viii.
p. 117, etc.

3. non crediderim, etc. On the re-
jection of scandals by Tacitus, and on his
reference to tradition as an authority for
motives‚ see Introd iv. p. 24, 26.

6. proximo priore anno: see c. 54, 3.

‘Proximo’ could have well stood alone,
as mc 22, ¹3 78. 3 etc.; but‘ proximus
superior' and* inferior’ are used with
apparently equal redundancy by Cicero
(Orat. 64, 116; de N. D. 2. 20, 52).

7. ocgisis, aoristic perfect ; cp. Introd.
V· § 54 ³

set. The MS. has ‘et‚’ which, as
closely followed by another ‘et.’ can
hardly stand. ‘Set ’ is suggested by the
marginal ‘sed,' and can stand without
‘etiam‚’ as c. 60, 1. Nipp. and Pfitzner
read ‘etiam,’ which, followed by ‘militi-
bus,’ could have been easily corrupted
into ‘et‚’ and is used thus without ‘sed ’
in 4. 35, 1, where similar stress is laid on
the second clause.

8. praetoriae cohortis, One of these

resulted in riot: see 13. 24, 1 ; 25, 4.

11. intercessit. On the position of
tribunes, and permissive exercise of their
veto at this time, see Introd. vi. p. 76.

Haterius Agrippa.. He is mentioned
as a relation of Germanicus and as
praetor (2. 51, 2, where see note), as con· .
sul(3. 49, 4; 52,1), andasamanof ς
profligate character (6. 4, 5). ³³

13 simulacra: cp. ‘durat simulacrum’ 'i
6. 11, 2. Asimilar dispute between prae· ἐ
tor and tribune is mlled· imago reipub-
licae’ in 13. 28, 1. Cp. ‘imago liberta-
tis' c. 81, 4; ‘antiquitatis’ 3. 60, 1.

14. immunes verberum. Augustus
appears from Suetonius (Aug. 45) to have
allowed the magistrates some power of

 
   
   
     
   
     
  

chastising actors(‘ coercitio’ >at the actual
time and place (‘ ludis et scena ';) and to
have himself ordered some to be scourged
(see on c. 54, 3). But this resolution ap-
pears to have contemplated the restora- ξ
tion of the general power as existing Ξ
‘omni loco et tempore, lege vetere' (Suet.
l.1.). See Marquardt, Staatsv. iii. p. 518. Ξ
The penalty substituted seems usually to
be banishment from Italy (4.14,4; 13(
25 ‚;4) which had also been inflicted
under Augustus: see Suet. 1. 1.

15. neque fas, etc. This obligation is:
stated, professedly in his own words, μ’ ᾗ
