γι CHARACTER AND GOVERNMENT OF TIBERIUS. 127

fortress of Capreae ². Accepting, on general authority, the counsel of
this adviser as the primary motive for such seclusion, Tacitus adds, with
perhaps more than due stress, others which we may place in the second
τεῦξ’. The dictation still exercised by Augusta, even at the age of
eighty-five, is intolerable to an almost septuagenarian son, and amounts
to a virtual claim to share the power which she had won for him. His
habits of life are said to have driven him to fly the restraint of society:
even his personal appearance to have led him to shun the eyes of men.
2 The tall gaunt form, awkward even in its erectness ³, has contracted an
ungainly stoop; the countenance, so refined and distinguished in his
busts and coins„has become a loathsome spectacle. Ξῖ

The period which begins with the concentration of a body-guard seems
aptly to end with almost a sels-imprisonment: and we appear to see a
picture, neither inconsistent nor indistinch of a phase intermediate be-
tween his best and worst3 one of an old age of mcreasing timidity, sus-
incion, and isolation‚ aggravated by a counsellor whose interest lay in

when, to the missortune of mankind, they are ‘armed with power.

These two periods, comprising together eight years and a quarter,

ῑιὶιιᾶίεό without the aid of Tacitus.

The Fifth Book opens with the death of Augusta, who, after having
{been charged, by hints more or less explicit, with every death in the
house of the Caesars, is now represented no longer as tbe‘ terrible step-
mother: but as the sole remaining protection of the family supposed to
L {have been most obnoxious to her‘. In another place such discrepancies
> ιτξε loosely accommodated by saying that she ostentatiously supported 1n
adversity those whom she had secretly undermined in their prosperity⁵.
Jg'ssl'he verdict of historical criticism has generally acquitted her of these
{finputationffi and regarded her throughout the long and unbroken period

&M her ascendancy, as a sostening and moderating influence on the cruel
ςτορεῐιεὶῐὶε5 of her husband and her son. And indeed, whatever her

,personal feeling towards the house of Germanicus, we may suppose her
ciently imbued with the policy of Augustus⁶‚ to see that her son had
more to gain than to lose by surrounding himself with family sup-

ᾗᾯοης and that it would not be desirable for him at the age of severity
