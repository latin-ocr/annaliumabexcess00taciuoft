Asin as matter of course. Five consulars
junior to M. Lepidus had already held
Asia or Africa: see Introd. vii. p. 95—97‚
and the explanation there suggested.
2. paternas . . . angustias: cp. r. 75,
² 5, where ¹ esse‚' here supplied, is expressed.
’ Borghesi notes that his father and grand-
‘ father (see on 7²· 3) had been pmscribed,
⁴ md though their lives were spared, had
“ probably suffered in property.
3. honori quam ignominiae. On the
'omission of ‘potius,' cp. c. 17, 7, and on
the dative, Introd. v. ξ 23.
habendam ducebat. From this'· ha-
bebu' is supplied with ‘ Lepidum ’ etc.
6, Inter quae. It is shown, from c.
’ ἡ 35. J, that this was an ‘egressio rela-
ἔπλετ’ seeon 2- 33. 2³ 37, 33 38, 3·
severu- caecina: cp. c. 18, 3.
7. obvenisset, sc. ⁶ sorte,’ as 4. 56, 3:
Cnes. B. C. 1. 6, 5, etc. The proposal is
thus limited to senatorial provinces, it
η hanguo function of the senate to make
,mles for those of Caesar.
multum anto repetito, ‘ recounting
‘in a. long preamble.’ On the abl„ see
t huod. ν. 5 31 a; on the use of ‘ repetere,‘
ο, 24, 2.
ἰ 8. concordem, not elsewhere with
l' 11ης but cp. ‘discors' c. 42, 3.
ς in publicum, ‘for the communityz’
, ⁶ publicum ’ stands in contrast to ‘ domi ’
'i *n c. 70, 4.

9. cohibita=‘ cum cohibuisset?
Introd. v. § 31 c.

10. quadraginta, apparently a round
number for 41: cp. 1. 64, 6; 2. 6, 1.

11. frustra: cp. e. 1. 30, 3.

placitum olim. The old rule (cp.
M. Sen. Controv. 9. 25, 251), though it
had such signal exceptions as Livia,
Agrippina, Plancina, etc„ was still on
the whole prevalent (cp. Suet. Aug. 24).
Ulpian (Dig. 1. 16, 4, 2), while stating
that the wife might go with her husband
to a province, thinks he would be better
without her, and mentions the ·decree
passed (see on 4. 20, 6) making him
responsible for her conduct. The wife
of Pilate was with him (Matt. 27, 19),
Drusilla with Felix (Acts 24, 24),
Calpurnia with Pliny (Epp. 10. 120,
121).

¹3- pacem, ‘ peaeesul duties :’ cp. ‘ pa-
cis impedimentum’ c. 34, 3.

14. barbari incessus, ‘ the progress of
a barbaric king,' with his train of women,
servants, etc.

16. ambitiosum, ‘intriguingz'
‘ambitiose' c. 13, 2, etc.

1 7. ad manum, ‘ at their beck.'

nuper: cp. 2. 55, 5: ‘praesedisse' is
somewhat an exaggeration. Caecina,
though here and in c. 18, 3 speaking as
an enemy of the enemies of Germanicus,
may have been unsriendly to Agrippina,
