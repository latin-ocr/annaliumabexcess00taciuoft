s 4, et deos. The MS. repeats these
words twioe, whence the marginal cor-

] fection ⁸ deos et dea5,’ which weakens the

rhetorical climax, but may possibly be a

ἐ fivrmula used by Tiberius (cp. 6. 6, Ι).

Such use of ‘et’ in the third place after
uyndeta is common in Tacitus and Livy
(Driiger, Synt. und Stil, § 106) ; and here
'socii’ and ‘ cives ' are referred to as one
class (=‘ homines ’) by ¹ illos.'

Philol. 23. 750) ; also from an inscription,
whether of temple or altar, ‘Romae et
Imp. Ti. Caesari Augusto sacrum,’ at
Mograwa in Africa Byzacena (C. Ι. L.
viii. 1, 685).

9. alii . . . interpretabantur, ‘some
explained this as modesty, many, as caused
by sels-distrust, some, as a sign of mean-
spiritedness.‘ The construction is varied
in each clause, and is in each abbreviated.
With ‘modestiam’ we should expect
‘tamquam‚' with ‘degeneris animi‚’ ‘sig-
num ; ' in the second, ‘ quod ’ is lost sight
of, and ‘aspernari talem cultum' supplied,
and ‘ diffideret' used absolutely, as in 1 3.
21, 9. The first view assumes the sin-
cerity of the reasons assigned by Tiberius
himself ; which‚whiledecliningthe honour,
are consistent with a belief that he has
deser-ved well of posterity. The second
view asserts that he had no such saith in
the judgment of the future on himself,
and assigns as the motive not true
modesty, but mere sels-depreciation. The
third affirms that he did not even care
for fame, simply because he had no losti-
ness os soul ; whereas the highest natures,
whatever their confidence in themselves
might be, have always aimed at the
highest honours, and the highest that
an autocrat can desire is posthumous
renown.

10. degeneris animi. The expression
is used in H. 3. 85, 2. The word is used
of ‘preces' and ‘vultus’ (12. 19, 1; H. 3.
65, 4): cp. ‘degeneres animos timor ar-
guit ' Verg. Aen. 4, 13.

12. melius, sc. ‘egissez’ cp. 1. 43, ¹:
