100 INTRODUCTION.

1. A. Severus Caecina, legatus probably from about 767—772‚ A. n.
14-19 ¹.

2. C. Visellius Varro, cos. suff. 765, A. n. 12 3 mentioned as legatus in
774, A. 1). 21 ².

3. L. Apronius, cos. suff. 761, A. n. 83 legatus in 781, A. D. 28 8; and
appears still to be so in 787, A. n. 34 ⁴.

The long tenure of appointments under Tiberius is further illustrated
by the fact that in Upper Germany C. Silius (cos. 766, A. n. 13) was
legatus from 767 to 774, A. n. 14-21⁵; and C. Lentulus Gaetulicus
(cos. 779, A. n. 26) from 782 to 792, A. n. 29-39 6; while L. Arruntius
‚ was nominally legatus of Spain for at least ten years⁷; and Poppaeus
Sabinus had charge of important provinces sor no less than twenty-four
years ⁸. The procuratores also were constantly retained in office ⁹.
Among such, it is known that Valerius Gratus ¹⁰ and Pontius Pilatus ¹¹
were respectively eleven and ten years procurators of Judaea3 768-779,
and 779-789, A. n. 15-26, and 26-36.

The legati and procurators had fixed salaries from the treasury¹²; ands

the former were assisted by their ‘ legati legionum ’ as vicegerents ¹³, while
in financial matters the PQatOT corresponded to the proconsul's
quaestor ¹⁴.

*These vast provinces cannot be here described 3 by far the most
important were the ‘ Germaniae ' and Syria. In each of the two former,
the legatus and his four legions lived asin a camp, confronted by warlike
tribes, and were also liable to furnish troops for a not impossible Gaulish
rising ²⁶. In Syria, the garrison of similar strength, if actually enervated
by peace, had yet the whole prestige of Rome in the East depending on
it; while the tact and firmness of its ruler would alike be exercised in
controlling the mixed crowd, Greek, Phoenician‚ and Jewish, made
subject to him, especially in his vast capital, Antioch : which, in popula-
tion second only to Rome itself¹⁶‚ by its seductions, as well as those of
its famous suburb of Epidaphna ¹⁷, would be fatal to many a soldier’s
