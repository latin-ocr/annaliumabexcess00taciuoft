1 ’1. Tum exuto’ iustitio reditum ad munia, et Drusus Illyricos
ad exercitus profectus est, erectis omniurn animis spe petendae
e Pisone ultionis et crebro questu, quod vagus interim per
amoena Asiae atque Achaiae adroganti et subdola mora sce-

2 lerum probationes subverteret. nam vulgatum erat missam, ut 5
dixi, a Cn. Sentio famosam veneficiis Martinam subita morte
Brundisii extinctam, venenumque nodo crinium eius occultatum,
nec ulla in corpore signa sumpti exitii reperta.

quae principem molliret ad Drusum pergit, quem haud fratris 10
interitu trucem quam remoto aemulo aequiorem 'sibi sperabat„

4th of April (Ov. F ast. 4, 179 sqq.) 3 but
we can hardly suppose that the mourning
had lasted continuously till then (see on
2. 82, 8). Ovid (1. 1.) describes the pro·
cession at these games, and speaks of
scenio and Circensian entertainments: see
Marquardt‚ Staatsv. iii. p. 355 sqq.

suberat, ‘was at hand:’ so used
by Cic. (Mil. 16, 4²) and Caesar (B. G. 3.

the writer, not a part of the edict.

1. Illyricos ad exereitus. On his
, mission. see 2. 44, etc. He returned
again for the trial (c. 11, 1). On the
plural ‘exercitus‚’ cp. c. 12, 6;Δ 1. 52, 3,
e c.

2. erectis, ‘roused to energy:' cp.
a. 25, 1, and ‘erectus Samnis' H. 3.

ope petendae . . . ultionis. ‘Spe'
is absent from the MS„ but inserted by
Orelli and Halm, aster F reinsheim. Nipp.
oetains the MS. text, which can possibly
be explained as a strong instance of a
gerundive genitive denoting purpose and
’ qualifying the whole sentence (Introd. V.
5 37, d): but the sense seems here to
require an expression of the instrumental
cause of excitement3 and ‘ spe’ could
most easily have been absorbed between
‘animis‘ and ‘ petendae! The more
common expression is ‘erectus in (or
’ῗὰῦ spem, as 2. 71, 13 H. 2. 74, 4,

5. probationes, ‘proofs‚’ or ⁴ evi-
ce; ² a meaning first found in Quint.
- , subverteret, ‘was destroying.’ The
next sentence explains the word, by sup-

posing that he had caused the death of
Martina; but of this· there appears to
belkno evidence beyond that of common

ut dixi, 2. 74, 2.

7. nodo οτίηίιιωεκορύμβῳ, possibly
in a hollow in the βελόνη. It was thus,
according to one version (Dio, 51. 14, 2),
that Cleopatra had secreted poison about
her.

8. nec . . . reperta. The inference
would seem to be that she had not com-
mitted suicide, but had been murdered
in some subtle manner. Nipp., on the
other hand, thinks it to be assumed that
she had poisoned herself ; and that the
important admission, that no signs of
poison were found in her body, is made
to point the other way; as arguing that
she must have used drugs that lest no
trace, which would explain the absence
of conclusive evidence in the case of
Germanicus (2. 73, 5). ‘Sumere mor-
tem’ is used of suicide in 13. 3ο, 3;
usually ‘sponte' is added, as in 2. 66, 2 ;
6. 2 5, 1, etc.

9. fflio: see 2. 76, 2, etc.

10. haud . . . quam. On the abbre-
viation of comparative clauses, see In-
trod. v. § 64. N ipp. notes here that the
constructions ‘ haud tam . . . quam,' and
‘ haud . . . sed,’ are mingled—the second
clause sostening the negation in the first—-
and compares the use of ‘non . . . quam'
in Plaut. Rud. 4. 3, 9; Liv. 2. 56, 9; 25.
15, 9.

11. sperabat: cp. 2. 56. 4.

12. integrum, ‘ unprejudiced z ’ cp. ‘ in-
tegris . . . animis* c. 12, 3.

13. liberalitatex' cp. 2. 37, 2, etc.
