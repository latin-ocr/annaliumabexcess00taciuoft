a maxlmum number, and the executions
due to a single order were probably over
in a day. It should also be remembered
that conspirators are not usually reckoned

ἰ by hundreds, and that many had been

ἦ twenty political executions in a day may

ated expressions of Tacitus: which would

almost describe a field of battle.

The death of Claudia is mentioned in c.
45, 6, and by Suetonius (Cal. 12), whose
chronology and that of Dio (58. 25, 2)
appear to differ from that of Tacitus (see
c. 3 , 2).

this passage, coupled with e. 45, 46, that
the judgment of Tacitus on Gaius is to be
mainly gathered.

the MS. ‘ exili0‚' which could only be ap-
plied to Nero. Drusus was not yet dead,
but Tacitus intends to describe the de-

period. The abl. is causal.

such metaphors as ‘ animum 1n uere ’ (ιι.
7, 5), and ‘ qualem diem haberet‘ (c. 21,
3), it is but a further step to ‘diem in-
duere.’ Burnouf notes such expressions as
‘ c'est son mauvais jour, son jour d'orage‚’
etc.‚ derived from observation of aperson’s
outward demeanour.

pari habitu, etc. These ablatives ap-
pear to be best taken as absolute, an-
swering to ‘rupta voce! Nipp. takes
them as ablatives of quality, similar to
that in 3. 43, 2. On ‘habitus,’ cp. 1.
