ᾗ 1. genitalem horam, ‘h' horoscope;'
: the position of the heavenljlfffirssat his
' birth, from which his destiny was to be
l calculated: so «dies genitalis’ 16. 14, 4,

¹3³¹. positus: cp. 4. 5, 4.

ἴ 3. quantum, with subjunctive 3 as in
. c. 19, 5.

' 4. trepidus admirationis et metus.
» The expression appears to resemble ‘am-
, biguus pudoris ac metus’ (2. 40, 2) and
uie construction to be that noted in Introd.
ῑνε 5 33 εγ. Elsewhere ‘trepidus' has
{sometimes a genitive of that for which
,tmxiety is felt; as ‘rerum’ (Verg. Aen.
⁷ maffia& ζ 1: egee’ti} supplied from
’‘foi-e· below. ‘Gratan'’ has here the
construction of a verb of speaking, as
fmiaerari’ 1. 39, 8, ‘defendere‘ 13. 43,
ᾖ, etc.

· 9. Sed mihi, etc. Tacitus introduces
ζ’ “ ions especially in this part of his
‘work (see c. 163 28) to vary the tale oi
,bnors which he laments to have as his
tant subject (c. 38, 1). Here the re-
Jttion of an apparently remarkable re-
diction and of the astrologica] skil of
'‚Tiberius suggests the question whether
‚there was anything in the matter more
than chance coincidence. On the general
nbjcct of this chapter, see Introd. iv. pp.
ω, 22; and compare the reflections of
:Pliny (N. H. 2. 7, 5, 22-27).

 
   
    
    
    
   
   
     

10. fatone . . . et necessitate. These
are here synonyms (Μοῖρα and ἀνάγκη).
‘Fatum’ is sometimes personified in Ta-
citus (H. 2. 69, 25 G. 33, 2; Agr. 13, 5),
sometimes associated with special divine
intervention (H. 4. 26, 2), and has various
other shades of meaning (see Introd. 1. 1.).

forte = τύχῃ. This word and ¹ for-
tuitus ’ have also their variations of mean-
ing. Here it is ‘chance' as opposed to
fate or law ; that which has no calculable
causes, and which no skill could predict: ·
in H. 4. 26, 2 it is another term for the
ordinary course of nature3 and natural
deaths are ‘fortuitae ' as opposed to vio-
lent (12. 52, 3; 16. 19, 4)ss ‘ fortuna,'
again, though in this passage opposed to
divine agency, is often personified as a l
deity (H. 4. 47, 2, etc.). ⁴¹²

11. sapientissimos . . 3
aemulantur, i.e. the founders of philo-
sophical systems, and their schools.

12. reperias. This is taken to be the
reading of the MS. text ‘ repericcs ; ’ and
a correction in an old hand, ‘reperiecs,'
is read as ‘reperies’ and adopted by
many editors. In 4. 33, 5, Halm reads
‘reperias,‘ after Madvig, against the MS. ;
in Dial. 12, 5, he retains ‘ reperies.'

multis, the Epieureans. x>

14. in bonos. On this use of ‘ in,’ see
Introd. v. § 60 b. ⁶ In ’ and ‘apud' are
interchanged for variety in 14. 14, 2 ς ‘ in '
and ‘ ad ' more frequently.

contra alii, h oics: thus Seneca
(Nat. Qu. 2. 36) defines ‘ fatum,' as ‘ne-
cessitas rerum omnium actionumque quam
nulla vis rumpat ε ’ holding that wise men,
