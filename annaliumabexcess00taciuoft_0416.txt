1. Philippopolim, ‘Philippopoliss in
the upper valley of the Hebrus (Mariua),
still one of the most important towns of
Roumelia.

Philippo, the father of Alexander the

Grgiattam: cp. 1. 39, 4. Tacitus nowhere

else(cp 2. 7, 3; 4. 55, 6, 6. 41, 2, etc.)
uses this participle with the prep. and
abL: whence some would read‘ positam'
(see Halm, Comm. Crit.,) on the analogy
of‘ posuere’ in 12.63,1.

3. P. Vellaeo. He appears to have
succeeded Flaccus in Moesia (see 2. 66,

35 also note on 1.80, 1). He has been
thought to have been the brother of the
historian, and to have been praetor with
him in 767, A. D. 14 (Vell. 2. 124, 4).
Nipp. thinks him probably brother to C.
Vellaeus Tutor (cos. ,uffi in 781, A. D.
28), who was one of the authors of the
‘ lex Iunia Vellaea.’

exercitum praesidebat. Tacitus
uses the accus. with this verb in the An-
nals (4. 5, ; 72 6; 12. 14, 7; 29, 3),
after Sall. (H 2. 28 D, 34 K, 52 G), and
analogously to his usage with many other
verbs (Introd. v. ξ 12 c).

4. alarios equites ae levis eohor-
tium, i. e. auxiliafies, as opposed to the
legion mentioned below (robur pedi tum')
cp. 12 31, 5. On the genitive, cp. Introd.
v. 32 e.

5. praedabundi, those described (c.
38, 6) as ‘turbantes praesentia?

8. regis . . . eruptione. Mommsen
cites (Eph. Epig. ii. p. 256) an inscrip-
tion commemorating the preservation of
Rhoemetalces, and of Pythodoris (see on
2. 56 3 67), who had been besieged with
him. ‘Eruptione ' and ‘adventu ' are

instrumental ablatives‚· but are coupled
to the abl. abs. preceding (cp. c. 37, 1).

9. aciem aut proelium. ‘pitched battle
or even conflict?

diei. The ins. pass. after ‘decet' is ,
rare, but in Cic. Tusc. 1. 14, 323 Verg. ,
Aen. 12, 797.

11. Galliarum. Os the four Gallie pro- 1 ³
vinces, two are wholly unaffected by this ¹

‘Germaniae' (see on 1. 31, 2). To the
former province belong the Aedui, alsd ¹

the latter the Treveri. ‚
