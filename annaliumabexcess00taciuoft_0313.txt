2. 128)· , and afterwards Vitellius‘ comitia
in decem annos ordinavit, seque perpetuum
consulem’ (Suet. Vit. ιι). The language
os Tiberius below. implying that the list
would always be full sor five years, would
show that the proposal was,- not for
elections to be held once in five years
only, but to designate at once magistrates
for five years to come, and afterwards,
ffinually, those for the fifth year from

e date.

utque legionum legati, etc. The
former part of the motion applied to all
magistracies, perhaps with exception of
the consulship, while this is a special
rule affecting the praetorship. The use
of the indicative ‘fungebantur ’ shows
that the twenty-five actual ‘legati le-
gionum' alone (see Introd. vii. p. 105) are
contemplated; so that this part of the
proposal would relate to the immediate
election only, which provided for the next
five years. As at other times (cp. H. 1.
48, 53 Agr. 7, 43 Suet. Vesp. 2, 4), it is
to be supposed that some of these ‘ legati '
had been already praetore ; the remainder
would be from the date of this motion
(⁸ iam tum ’) destined as such ; with them
the princeps would nominate others up to
sixty, and distribute them in groups of
twelve over the five years. The reason
for some special provision respecting
these‘ legati’ might be their neces ssary
absence at the timge of candidature. The

‘nominatio principis ’,here as in 1. 14, 6,
would be tantamount to‘ commendatio,
