3. eam condicionem, ‘it is of the

friend of ovid (ex P. 4. 1, 4, 8), may
essence of ruling, that accounts will not

have shared in the relationship indicated

come right if audited by others than the
ruler.’ This may mean either that the
ruler must give account of his actions to
no one; or that his subordinates, above
all his military subordinates, to whom
Tiberius here professes to have given no
orders, must be responsible to him alone:
it is implied either way that much must
be done by or sor an autocrat which will
not bear investigation. On ‘condicio‚’
cp. ‘ condicio vivendi ‘ Hor. Sat. 2. 8, 65.
The metaphor ‘ ratio constat' seems to
be suggested by ‘ rationem reddendam:'
in Pl. Min.‚ e.g. in Epp. 1. 5, 17; 1. 9,
13 2. 4. 4, etc„ ‘ratio constat· comes
to mean ‘it is good,’ or ‘it is reason-
able!

5. eonsules, patres.eques. On the use
of asyndeta‚ see Introd. v. ξ 65 ; on the
use of singular for plural, as in ‘eques,'
and, below, ‘miles‚' see Id. ξ 2. The
collective sing. ‘eques' is used of the
equestrian order in 4. 74, 5, etc„ also
¹} Hor. (Epp. 2. ι, 185), Mart. and

‘uetl

6. falsi, ‘hypocriticaL’ as 3. 3, 1; 13.
13, 4, etc. The use seems taken from
Sa11.‚ who has ‘ambitio multos mortales
falsos fieri subegit‘ Cat. 10, 5.

7. composito, used of studied effects
in word or look, as 2. 34, 6; 3. 44, 4,
etc.

ne laeti, sc. ‘essent.’ See Introd. v.
5 39 b, and Nipp. here.

8. Sex. Pompeius et Sex. Appuleius.
These consuls are stated by Dio (56.
29, 5) to have been related to Caesar3
which explains their continuance in office
throughout the year. Pompeius, who is
mentioned 3. 11, 25 32, 2, and as a

in 2. 27, 2. That of Appuleius may be
gathered from 2. 50, 1. ’

9. primi . . . iuravere. This oath
(⁸ sacramentum in nomen Tiberii ‘ c. 8, 5)
taken by the whole people‚ and by the
provinces (c. 34, Ι), is a recognition of
Caesar’s sole ‘proconsulare imperium‘
throughout the empire. See Introd. vi.
p. 70; Momms. Staatsr. ii. p. 768. It
must be distinguished from the oath
taken to maintain the aeta (see c. 72, 2).
The consuls, as the chief senatorial magis-
trates, appear here, after themselves
swearing allegiance, to administer the
oath to the two chief non-senatorial
officers (on whom see Introd. vi. p. 72).
All other magistrates or praefecti appear
to take it only as members of the senate
or equestrian order. It is therefore
possible that the absence of separate
mention of the ‘praefectus urbis‚’ who
was always a senator, may no more prove
that office to have been in abeyance than
the regular senatorial magistracies (see
on 6. 11). The ‘praefectus vigilum’ is
also unmentioned.

ιο. Seius Strabo, the father of Seianus
⁴(c. 24, 3; 4. 1, 3), afterwards praefectus
of Egypt (Dio, 57. 19, 6). His praeno—
men was Lucius (Insc. Henzen 5394).

C. Turranius, probably the first per—
son appointed to the office, which was of
recent institution (Momms. p. 996). He
was still holding it thirty-four years later
(11. 31, 1), though Seneca makes him
&ready ninety in the time of Gaius (Brev-

it. 20, 2).

11. senatun milesque et populus.
These are coupled as making up the
whole population, 11. 30, 5.
