2. colonias novas. The antithesis to
‘antiqua' would show that ‘novas’ be-
longs to the general contrast, and does
not merely distinguish new colonies from
older ones; but a special contrast appears
to be drawn between dwelling in their
fatherland. and migrating to ‘ new settle-
ments,' such as those of many tribes, and

now of Segestes and his train, on the'

‘victa ripa.' That the Romans, is they
conquered Germany, would plant Roman
colonies in it, though probable enough,
is not here to the point.

through Westphalia.

to whom Ovid addresses an epistle

the campaigns of Germanicus, of which
Μ. Seneoe. (Suas. 1, 15) has preserved a
fragment. See Appendix to Book ii.

local ablative, see c. 8, 4, and Introd. v.
ξ 25; and the further instances collected
here by Nipp.

Frisiorum. This tribe, at resent
subject to Rome (see 4. 72, 1), is ivided
by Tacitus (G. 34, 1) into ‘ maiores’ and
⁴ minores.’ The Frisii occupied most of
the coast of Holland, where part of their
territory still retains the name of F ries-
land. They continued to be important
aster their revolt from Rome, and formed
part of the English conquerors of Britain.

11. lacus, See 2. 8, 15 G. 34, 1. One
of these is the lake Flevo of Mela 3. 2,
24. Since the great inundations of the
thirteenth century, these lakes have be-
come merged in the Zuider Zee.

12. praedictum. Nipp. takes this to
mean ‘before-mentioned: as in Liv. 10.
14, 7; and often in Velleius. In 2. 6,
4, etc„ it means ‘appointed‚’ and may
also be so taken here.

Chauci. See c. 38, 1.

13. in commilitium adsciti, repeated
from H. 3. 5, 2. The word ‘commi-
litium' appears not to be found earlier
than in Ovid and Velleius.

14. 12. Stertinius; mentioned often
during these campaigns, and always as a
leader of cavalry and light troops. Cp.
c. 71, 1; 2. 8, 4; 11, 4;17‚ 1; 22, 3.
