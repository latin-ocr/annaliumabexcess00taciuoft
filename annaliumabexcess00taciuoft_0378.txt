⁴ praepositam‚' which would rather describe
such an arrangement as that at the funeral
of Augustus (Dio, 56. 34, 1), where the
position of a waxen effigy on the couch
has to be contrasted with that of the real
body below; whereas in such a case as
this no real body could have been present.

toro. Unless ‘ praepositam’ be read,
this must be taken as a free use of the
abl. of place; as also ‘externis terris'
above: see Introd. v. ξ 2 5.

meditata, ¹ prepared :¹ so used passively
4. 57, 1 ; 70, 6, ete. ‚ and in several places
in Cic.

1. earmina, verses to be sung by a
choir. Such a poem was composed by
Clutorius Priscus, but probably not till
afterwards (c. 49, 1).

et lacrimas. Nipp. notes that these
are not, like the former words, in apposi-
tion to ‘veterum instituta,' but refer to
the conduct of Tiberius and others.

vel, ‘or even.'

imitamenta: cp. 13. 4, ις 14. 57, 5.
The word is not found before Tacitus, and
very rarely later.

3. Gnarum: cp. 1. 5, 4, etc.

utque premeret, ‘ to repress! The
sense is mostly poetical, and ostener used
of sels-control (e. g. c. 11, 2; 6. 50, 5).

4. ob rem publicam obisse, referring
to the inscriptions mentioned in 2. 83, 3.

6. egregium, ‘honourablez' cp. ‘mihi
egregium erat' (H. 1. 15, 1), and the subst.
c. 70, 43 6. 24, 3, etc. : apparently a

Tacitean sense of the word.

adiceretur. Drager notes that this
verb is nowhere else used in this phrase
for ‘adhibere’

7. principibus viris. Nipp. notes
that while this is thrown in to explain his

own apparent apathy‚ the addition of

'imperatori populo’ removes the appa-
rent self-exaltation by raising the nation
to his level. On the adjectival ‘impe-
rator‚’ cp. Introd. v. ξ 3: also ‘ liberator
populus* (Liv. 35. 17, 8).

8. ex maerore solacia. On the con-
struction, see note on 1. 29,
sentiment resembles that of Ovid (Trist.
ἔ. 13. 38) ‘expletur lacrimis egeriturque

o or.'

10. divus Iulius . . . divus Augustus.
Their firmness on these occasions is
dwelt on by Seneca (Cons. ad Marc. 14,
33 15, 2): also Suetonius says of the
latter (Aug. 65), ‘aliquanto patientius
mortem quam dedecora suorum tulit?

3. The ⁴

Julia, only daughter oi Caesar and wife '¹
of Cn. Pompeius, died while her father ,-
was in Britain, in 700, Β. C. 54. On the —

death of the grandsons of Augustus, see
1. 3, 3.

13. amissas nobiles familias, re-.
ferring apparently to the story of the τ

Fabii at the Cremera (Liv. 2. 50).

14. principes: not here in a special
sense, but = ‘ great men?

15. sollemnia, ‘ their usual employ-
ments.'

Megalesium. These began on the
