CORNELII TA CI TI ANNALIUM

[A. U.c. 790.

praetorius ut in insulam deportaretur, Pontius Fregellanus amit-
teret ordinem senatorium, et eaedem poenae in Laelium Balbum
decernuntur, id quidem a laetantibus, quia Balbus truci elo-
quentia habebatur. promptus adversum insontes.

20, 3); and notes the double construction
used with ‘ decernere’ in 1. 15. 4 (where
see note).

Carsidius Sacerdos: see 4. 13, 3.
He appears to have been praet. urb. in
780, Α. D. 27 (see Nipp)5

2. eaedem poenae, i. e. the‘ (1392ssst-
tio,' involving necessarily the loss¹ of se-
natorial rank. Nipp. notes that Tacitus
separated this case from that of Carsidius,
only to make a special remark on it. On
Laelius Balbus, see c. 47, 1.

5. consulari familia. He· must have
been son of the consul of the preceding
year (see c. 40, 1), 110 other consul of the
name being found. The same expression
is used' ln a similar sense in 13.12,1.

6. insprmem, ‘unseemly‚' i. e. ‘igno-
minious, ’as compared with the more dig-
nified forms of suicide. So Vergil calls a

noose sor hanging ‘nodum informis leti'
(Aen. 12, 603).

in praeceps, from an upper win-
dow: cp. 4. 22, 1. q

7'. repudiata. Nipp. takes this in its
ordinary sen‘se as ‘divorced from her hus-
band.' Others take it as ‘repelled’ by
her son, which suits the context well;
but if Tacitus had meant this, he would
probably have used a less ambiguous
word.

adsentationibus atque luxu. Roth
appears rightly to take this as equivalent
to ‘adsentand0‚ iuvando ad. luxum?

10. advolveretur: cp. 1. 13, 7.

luctumque communem, etc.. the
grief which men or women alike would

idern animi rigor3

sermone ac vultu intentus)

feel at the loss of children, and the greater
inability of her sex to bear up against it.
The bearing of the appeal is to show that
in the death of her son she had already
suffered enough.

1 1. in eundem doloremst to the same
piteous effect,’ i. e. ‘in e
aggia? cp. ‘verba m eandem clementiam’
11. 3, 1. The construction is a form of
the‘ in consecutivum‚’ so characteristic of
Tacitus: see Introd. v. ξ 60 b.

1 2. diu ferret, for ‘ proferret :' so ‘ferre
crimina’ 12. 4, 1, etc. For the use of
‘ diu: see note on 4. 69, 4.

13. minor filius, probably the person
mentioned by Seneca (de Ira, 3. 18, 3), as
a victim to the ferocious caprice of Gaius,
Ὀ. Caesar Sextum Papinium‚ cui pater
erat consularis, flagellis cecidit, torsit, non
quaestionis sed animi causa! He may
have taken his brother's praenomen.

lubricum iuventae. Tacitus has
other similar metaphors, as ‘lubricum
adolescentiae' 14. 56, 2, lubricam prin-
cipis aetatem' 13. 2, 2, etc.

exstet.. The poetical-. aecus, with
this verb, found here alone in Tacitus
(cp. ‘limen exire' Ter. Hec. 3. 3, 18,
‘valles’ Ov. Met. 10, 52), is analogous
to those noted in Introd. v. 5 1 2 c.

14. Iam . . . nondum. The contrast
seems a reminiscence of Liv. 1. 2 5, 6 ‘ Ro-
manas legiones iam spes tota, nondum
tamen cura deseruerat.’

15. idem animi rigor. ‘ there was the
same stem will: Pliny spea s (N. . 7.
