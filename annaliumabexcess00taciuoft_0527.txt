Vell. 2. 130, 3, and Quint.

several instauoes in which the substantive,
belonging to the demonstrative, is attract-

ἓ Itis here also to be noted that the sen-
i tuce is not in meaning strictly equivalent

(which would imply that some services to
Rmne were relied on rather thau others) ;
hit ‘officia’ is rather to be understood

11. Zmyrnaeos praetulere. A Smyr-
naean coin is extant, bearing on the ob-
verse the figure of Tiberius in the‘centre
of a temple, and the inscription Σεβα-
στὸς Τιβέριος, the reverse being inscribed
Σεβαστή and Σῦνκλητοςε Eckh. ii.

Vibius Marsus: cp. . 74, 1.

M’. Lepido: cp. 3. 32, 2. His pro-
consulate is also attes d by an inscription
at Pergamum ‘ prae fabr. M'. Lepidi
procos.' (C. I. L. iii. 1, 398). That ‘ea
provin‘cia’ is Asia,i implied in ‘Zmyr-
naeos.

numerary legate sh uld be appointed:'
ep. 2. 47, 5. Accor 'ng to Dio (53. 14,

three in number; but ipp. notes that his
statement that they x re also consulars is
not borne out by inse iptions.

15. meditatam passive, as in 3. 5, 6,
etc.: not here apparently in the same
sense as ‘meditans ' in 3. 31, 2.

16. abscessit: so Halm; Otto and
Haase insert ‘concessit‘ (cp. 3. 31, 2)
before or aster ‘in Campaniam3' and
other such corrections have been made by
others. Nipp. and Orelli retain the MS.
text, supplying the idea of a verb of mo-
tion from the sense (see Introd. v. ξ 38
b). The remedies are violent, but on the
other hand the passages cited by Nipp.
seem hardly parallel. Such omissions are
suitable to epistolary style; or to rapid
