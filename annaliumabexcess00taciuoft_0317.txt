the word in the MS„ is supported by
Inscr. Orelli 3671 (of the time of Trajan),
and Henzen 5148.

1 2. crinem barbamque promitteret:
‘nam’ implies that this was adopted as
an additional resemblance. Nipp. notes
that such was not the normal Roman
mode, but may have been copied from
the unkempt state of Agrippa in his
banishment.

13. dissimili in. The preposition has
the force of πρός, and the expression is
nearly equivalent to a simple dative: see
Introd. v. ξ 60 b, and note on 1. 76, 5.

Dio (57. 16, 3) gives a less probable
version, making him collect a large
body of followers in Gaul as well as
Italy, and almost descend in force on
