‘inlustres domi artes ' 4. 6, 2 ; also 3. 70,
1; 12. 6, 2; 14. 55, 6. In 6. 7, 1 he
speaks of the ‘sanctissimae artes’ of
Arruntius; in 11. 6, 4, a speaker mentions
his ‘incorrupta vita et facundia,’ elassing
him even with Pollio and Messala.
Seneca, however, if he refers to this
Arruntius (see above), considers the style
of his History of the Punic wars an exag-
. geration of the mannetisms of Sallust.

best taken, with Ruperti, as ε ‘iudicio

4. 38 1; 60, 4, etc. On the frequent use
by Tacitus of such adjectival substantives‚
see c 6.

sufficia-xri is best taken absolutely,
as in G. 13, 1 : Dial. 37, ι, etc.: so as to
leave ‘adipisci' dependent only on the
verbs: though ‘sufficere’ takes an in-
finitive in Verg. Aen. 5, 22.

3. vel certainly stands sometimes in
Tacitus sor‘ aut? as 13. 41, 33 μὲ 35, 5,
etc.; but here Nipp. appears n'g hlty to
show that, as in 14.3, 1 (‘ in hortos aut
Tusculanum vel Antiatem 1n agrum ¹,) he
is not so much contrasting three classes
with each other, as two 'of them with
a third; those who, with or without
capacity, would desire the position, with
those who would not.

4. Μ’. Lepidum. This praenomen is
given in full, 3. 22, 2. Elsewhere the MS.
always reads M. thus consusing this
Lepidus with another, whose praenomen

‘'Marcus is written full· in 3. 32, 2 (where
see notes). On Manius Lepidus see further
3351, 50‚1;4·‚203;56‚3; 6·27‚4·
He was consul ιη 764, A. D. 11.

5. et is a variation for the preceding

‘,’sed and often stands for an adversative
pasticle. where the words sufficiently

convey the opposition, as ‘turbidos et
nihil ausos’ c. 38, 4. Cp. 12. 52, 3, 14.

12. 28, 1; 50, 1; 13. 36, 2. chiefly from
Sall„ e. g. Jug. 25, 9, etc.

omnes. This should apply to all
the other three; but the absurdity of
supposing that Tiberius contrived the fall
of Piso makes Nipp. contend that the re-
mark about him is parenthetical, and that
only two out of the three originally men-
tioned are referred to. In any case
Tacitus oversteps his own facts, for
Tiberius is admitted to have been prob·
ably not eognisant of the charge against
Arruntius (6. 47, 4); so that ‘ omnes' and
‘mox‘ are justified only by the fate of
Gallus some sixteen years later, on which
see note on 6. 23, 1.

8. Q. Haterius. a consular (2. 33, 1),
probably cos. suff. in 745, B.c. 9* (Borg-
hesi) ; a man of servile disposition (3. 57,
3), anda fluent but careless speaker (4.
61, 2). On his probable marriage with a
daughter of Agrippa, see Introd. ix. note
19. .
9. Mamercus Scaurus, of similar
character (3. 66, 3), was cos. suff. possibly
in 774, A.D. 21 (Borghesi). On his ac- ,

date, is ascribed to the influence of
Macro.

10. quousque, etc. The whole sentence
might give offence from its tone of im-
patience, like the ⁸ aut agat, aut desistat ’
of some other speaker (Suet. Tib. 24);
and ⁴ caput reipublicae ’ is an expression
more suited to the senate (cp. H. 1. 84,
6), than, at this early date, to the
‘ princeps.¹ The words of Scaurus would
