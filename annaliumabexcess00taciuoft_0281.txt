1. raro venatu, segni . . . eura.
Usually taken as abl. of quality; but
‘gestamine’ and ‘fastu’ would be more
naturally instrumental, and there is no
need to suppose a change of construction.
Justin states (41. 3, 3) that the Parthians
ate no flesh but that taken in the chase‚
ffigk were never seen out except on horse-

2. quotiens . . . incederet5 subjunct.
of repeated action: cp. Introd. v. ξ 52.

laeuone gesta-minet cp. ‘ gesta-
mine sellae’ 14. 4, 63 15. 57, 3; and
‘eodem gestamine’ 11. 33, 3. The word,
generally poetical and post-Augustan‚ is
otherwise almost exclusively used of that

- which is worn or borne.

erga. The use of this word to express

every kind of feeling or mere relation
·· towards a person or thing, is especially,

though not exclusively, Tacitean. See

'⁷ Introd. v· 5 593 Nipp. on c. 76. For
ι other inmnoes of its use in application

to things or abstract conceptions, cp. 4.
2ο. 2; 11. 25, 8; 16. 33, 1, etc.; and a

f, few instanoes in earlier authors, as ‘erga
ῑ, meam salutem’ Cic. Prov. Cons. 1, 1;

att. 8. 3, 2.
,3. epulan. The feasts with the ‘ me-
gistanas} only suspended as an aet of
gneuming (⁶iustitii instar'); Suet. Cal. 5.

Gnaei comites. Probably men of
ἒῗίειῖ, as those attendant on Tiberius (4.

utensilium, ⁸ stores : ’ cp. 1. 70, 6.

ἒ. anulo clausa: cp. Plin. N. H. 33.

vindicantur a rapina ;’ also Plaut. Cas. 2.

. ⁸a. 2, ι34ς Juv. 14, 13²· etc. These pre-
cantium against pilfering slaves would
neem mean to Parthians.

prompti aditus, etc. It seems best

. to supply ⁸ erant: not with these clauses,

but with ‘ nova vitiass taken as predicate
to the whole, and explained by ‘ et quia,‘
etc., following. ι’

obvia, ‘ affable: i.e. ready to meet
all halsway: ep. obvium obsequium’ H.
1. 19, 23 and ‘obvius' thus used of a
person in Plin. Epp. 1. 10, 2.

5. moribus. Generally adopted, after
Muretus, for the MS. ‘maioribus'

7. Arsacidarum e sanguine. By his
mother’s side only (6. 42, 4): on his fa-
ther's side he was probably a Dahan, or
of Hyrcanian or Carmanian blood; see 6.
36, 5. According to Josephus (Ant. 18.

Dahas. This Scythic race, border-
ing on the Arii (11. 10, 3), and grouped
by Strabo (11. 8, 2, 511) with the Sacae
and Massagetae. must have then lived
between the Caspian, the sea of Aral, and
the Oxus ; though the modern Daghestan
shows trace of them at some other time
further west. They are known as a war-
like race to Vergil (Aen. 8, 728).

8. primo congressu fusus. This vic-
tory is commemorated by coins, dating
A. D. 9-11‚ inscribed Βασιλεὺς Ὀνώνης vec:
