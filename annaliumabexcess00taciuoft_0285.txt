tives (¹ aliae,’ etc.) are in apposition.
Nipp. ‘ Citae ’ ,is to be taken as a

participle. ⁴
augebantur. This may mean that
the soldiers showed their zeal by building
them higher than was usual, to look
more imposing (cp. 15. 9, 1, and ‘ vallum
ue castrorum augebat’ H. 4. 34,

8); or perhaps better, that the spirit of

the soldiers made the fleet seem still
more imposing and formidable. On the
force of ‘in,' cp. Introd. v. ξ 60 b. The
form of the similar expression ‘acies in
speciem simul ac terrorem . . . constiterat ’
(Agr. 35. 3), would show that the words
are not here to be taken strictly as a
hegiliadys, though in meaning nearly
su .

1. insula Batavorum: see G. 29, 1;
H. 1², 2, etc. It was known to Caesar
g. “. 4. 10, 1), and is called ‘ nobilissima ’

ΒΙὶῃγ (Ν. Η. 4. 15, 29, 101). The
modern district Iaetuwe preserves the
name. The true mouth of the Rhine as
here described appears to be the now in-

' cant stream still mlled the old
, ’ , which passes by Utrecht and
Iaeyde‘n. On some other points in this
description and that of Caesar, see Mr.
Long in Dict. of Geog.‚ s. v. ‘ Batavi?

2. adpulsbtff, ‘landing-places: ' cp. ‘ad-
pellerenss'a ve.

enemy's countryz' so ‘ transmiserat bel-
lum’ H. 2. 17, 13 ‘ne . . . transmittant
bellum' Liv. 21. 20, 4.

5. velut, i. e. not strictly two; for
only one branch retains the name.

6. praevehjtur. Ruperti notes the
frequent use in Tacitus of verbs com-
pounded with ‘ prae' for those with
‘ praeter ; ' as ‘ praefluere ’ c. 6 3, 1 ;

⁴ ‘ praegredi ' 14. 2 3, 4 ; ‘ praelegere ’ c. 79,

Livy or poets.

7. placidior adfluens ε cp. ‘violentior
effluit amnis' Verg. G. 4, 373.

8. cognomento: cp. 1. 23, 6. Nipp.
notes here the interchange for variety's
sake, of ⁴ nomen ' . . . ‘ cognomento ’ . . .
‘vocabulum; ’ and similar changes in 3.
56, 2; also ‘nominibus’ . . . ‘appella-
tiones’ . . . ‘nomina’ . . . ‘vocabulum’
(G. 2, 3), etc. The construction passes
on from ‘ adfluens ’ to ‘ mutat‚’ as if the
intermediate clause had been ‘ Vahalis. . .
vocatur?

Vahalem. In Caes.. B. G. 4. 10, 1
the VVaal is called ‘ Vacalus,¹ in Sid.
Apoll. (see Nipp.) ‘ Vachalis.' In H. 5.
19, 3, Tacitus calls the Waal the Rhine‚
and in H. 5. 23, 2 speaks as if the Maas
received the whole Rhine.

11. adiguntur: ‘naves adigere ‘ seems
a regular phrase (cp. 11. 18, 23 H. 2. 83,
23 3. 47, 3) to express the concentration
or collection of a fleet at one spot.

12. Chattos. This expedition, like that
of last year (ι. 55, ι), seems intended to
prevent their assisting the Cherusci.
