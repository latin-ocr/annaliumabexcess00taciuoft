were sent to Caesar in his absence (Suet.
Tib. 73). and their compiler must have
been so sar in his confidence as to receive
instructions to suppress record of anything
obnoxious. On the construction of ‘ cre-
ditus‚‘ see Introd. v. § 45.

1. fatali quodam motu, ‘impelled
somehow by his destiny;' i. e. by some
inexplicable motive: see on 3. 30, 7.

constantiae, ‘courage3' as 1. 32,1;
15 55, 7, ete.

2. prava, ’1η15ς111ἀ5ᾶῗ i. e. mistaking
his true interest. Τ 15 explained by
the following words. he overlooked the
present danger of thwarting Caesar, on
the uncertain chance that he might
change his mind and punish them for
their zeal.

3. pavet. The accus. with this verb
is poetical, but found in Sall. Cat. 31, 3,
andPl. mai.. · cp.15. 11, 2; H. 3. 56,3,
and the use of‘ pavescere ’(1. 4, 2, etc.)‚
and‘ expavescere ’(H. 2. 76, 3),

inserere se: so in H. 2.19,3; cp.
6. 2, 1; Ovid‚ etc.

relationem inciperent.
phrase is used in 13. 26, 2.
. 4. brevibus momentis summa. verti,
‘small things turn the scale 111 great
events;’ i e. some influence too slight
now to be foreseen may change Caesar’s
whole purpose. The sentiment is that
of Cicero (Phil. 5. 10, 26) ‘minimis mo-
mentis maximae inclinationes temporum
fiuntz· cp ‘momenta deficientis’ Agr.
43, 3, ‘momentumque suit mutatus Curio
rerum’ Luc. 4,;819 and note on 4. 32,
4. For this sense οῖ’* brevis,’ Orelli well
compares 'breve pondus' Hor. Sat. 2.

The same

posse . . . seni. The corrupt MS.
text‘ germanicis titium paenitentiae senis'
has exercised the ingenuity of all com-
mentators. Walther has collected some
fourteen suggestions which had found

more or less favour down to his own ’

111115. For others, see Halm (Comm.

Crit.); Pfitzner (p. 100); Ritter (Rhein. “

Mus. xvii. p. 130). The above reading

(Halm and Nipp.) would express what ,

1111151 have been the sense of the original

text3 and the absorption of‘ esse? be· ,

1ν15511“2.5”511(1 5,’ as well as the addition

of‘ s’ to‘ seni? from. ‘simuL' can be ¹

supposed without difficulty y: but‘ domus,’

though required by the sense, cannot have ’

dropped out so easily; and it is not im-
probable that some words amounting to
a whole line in an original MS. may have
been lost.

6. effigies . . .

similar mode of showing attachment to {-
