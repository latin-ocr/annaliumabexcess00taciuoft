2; requirentibus H. 1. 27, 3, etc.; such instances are not always clearly ¹
distinguishable from datives; but are found also in Caesar and Livy. q
Dr. § 212 a, b, Nipp. on 1. 29; 5. 10.

(d) The transitive use, in this case, ‘ff deponent participles, as secutus ἒ
6. 17, 43 11. 25, 15 ausus 12. 32, 2; adgressus 13. 43, 8, is analogous ‘j
to the use of omnia pollicito in Sallust, Jug. 103, 7, and gratum elocuta ³
in Hor. Od. 3. 3, 17. Dr. ξ 212 c, Wolfflin (Phil. 26. 134).

32. Partitive οι· quasi-partitive. The abundance of such genitives
is characteristic of Tacitus, as also the frequency with which the partitive j
idea is almost or altogether lost sight of, and the genit. equivalent to a ³1
simple adj. as in poetry. Cp. strata viarum (Lucr. and Verg.). 53

(a) After neuter singular, without the usual restrictiori to an adj. or ἐξ
pron. in the nom. or accus. (Roby 1226): thus umido, lubrico paludum
r. 61, 2 ; 65, 6. The use of such a gen. after an adj. or pron. governed :3
by a preposition is especially rare (Madv. 285, Obs. 1.), as in prominenti 4
litorisj1. 53, 7 ; post multum vulnerum 12. 56, 5. Dr. 66 a, b.

(b) After neuter plural, still more frequent: as cuncta curarum 3. 35,
13 tacita suspicionum 4. 41, 1; simulationum falsa 6. 45, 6, etc. Dr.
<66 b) gives a full list of words so used ς cp. Madv. 284, Obs. 5, Kennedy
172, 8.v

(c) Also very common after masculine or feminine, as with pauci,
multi, alii, etc„ and in such expressions as quinque consularium 3. 28, 6 ; 3
leves cohortium 3. 39, 1 ; cunctis civium 1 1. 22, 4. See the full list given vJ

by Nipp. on 3. 39.
(d) With adverbs. Tacitus adopts sreely the extension of the Cice-
ronian usage with ubi, ubicunque, longe, eo, and huc : as eo furoris 1. -

18, 2, etc. 3 huc adrogantiae 3. 73, 1, etc. Dr. (ξ 67) notes with this the
gen. after sponte 2. 59, 3, etc. (Luc. and Pl. mai.).

(e) The genitivus appositzbnzs (Dr. ξ 74), as uligines paludum 1. 17, 5,
though more properly to be styled a defining gen. (Madv. 286), is akin in
meaning to those mentioned.

(s) The expression pensi habere (Dial. 29, 13 H. 1. 46, 43 Ann.
13. 15, 5), adopted from Sallust, Livy, and Quintilian, and perhaps mis-
understood in its construction by Tacitus (Roby 1301), as also the
phrase nihil reliqui facere (1. 21, 4), are referred to this head by
Madvig (285, Obs. 2) ς by Dr. (ξ 73) to the gen. (or locative, Roby 1 186)
of price.
