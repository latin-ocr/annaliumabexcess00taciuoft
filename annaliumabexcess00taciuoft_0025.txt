*GENUINENESS OF THE ANNALS.

- 11· has not hitherto been thought necessary for any editor of these
books to establish their genuineness; but the recent attempt² to prove
them to be a forgery by Poggio Bracciolini in the fifteenth century,
ξ while it cannot be said to have found such acceptance as to necessitate
a full discussion ⁸, may make it desirable briefly to subjoin some ex-
terna] evidence to show that they are at least the work of an ancient
author.
It will be sufficient to speak here of the Books contained in this

³ volume, and resting on the first Medicean MS.
λ We have no reason to suppose that any scholar of the time of
J Bracciolini had access to historians of this period who are lost to us.
, ’ Even those whom we have must have been known to him only in
manuscripts. The inventor of a Tacitean history of the principate of

ἒ to compose a Tacitean history of that of Gaius or Domitian. He

‘ could be gleaned from. other authors, and must invent the rest of the
material, as well as the form and language. Any careful comparison

J almost in proportion to their intrinsic unimportance.
