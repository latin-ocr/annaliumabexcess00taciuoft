compound verbs, see Introd. v. ξ 12 c.
The more usual dat. with ‘ advolvi 'is also
found, c. 23, 2; 32, 4.

9. an, without ‘ dubium ' or ¹ in-
certum' preceding, found especially often
in the Annals‚ as c. 65, 3 ; 2. 42, 5, etc„
though not absent in Cic.. Sall„ or Liv.
See references in Nipp.

11. oraret. On the subj of facts with
‘donec‚' see on c. 1, 4.

be more offensive, as insinuating that
Tiberius was not in earnest.

2. relationi consulum. The terms of
such a ‘ relatio ' can be gathered from H.
1. 47, ². and more fully from the ‘ Lex de
Imp. Vespasiani? On the present occasion
its form must have been modified by the
powers already possessed by Tiberius.
See Introd. vi. pp. 68, 82 ; Mommsen,
Staatsr. ii. p. 762, soll.. 869.

4. traminit. This verb is used in this
age in the sense of ‘praetermittere,’ with
¹ silentio’ or similar words, and with accus,
os the thing (as H. 1. 13, 5; 4. 9, 3) or the
person (as Suet. Vaep. 15).

5. flexit, sc. ‘se,' as 4. 37, 2, etc.
Suet. (Tib. 24) says that he complained
‘miseram et onerosam iniungi sibi servi-
tutem} and consented only with the re-
servation ‘dum veniam ad id tempus, quo
vobis aequum possit videri, dare vos
aliquam senectuti meae requiem.’ From
the silence of Tacitus it has been doubted
whether any formal decree was passed;
but we ean hardly suppose that Tiberius
thus left his position unsecurecL and he
could not have sormally become ⁴ prin-

* oeps' or ‘Augustus ’ without such decree.

7. oon-tat Haterium. Suet. (Tib.
27) tells this story without the name of

· the person, only to illustrate the aversion

οἱ Tiberius to such prostrations.
8. genua advolveretur. This constr.
taken from Sall. (see Introd.v. ξ 97, 1) is

>used byTacstus, 6. 49. ,κς 15. 71, 13 H.

4. 81, 2. On other such accusatives aster

Walther is right in thinking the question
between these titles merely one of sound.
Both ‘ pater ' and ‘ parens ’ ⁵ patriae '
appear to have been used of Cicero (Juv.
8, 243) and Julius Caesar (Suet. Jul. 76 ς
85). On the titles borne by the wife or
mother os the princepS, see Mommsen,
Staatsr. ii. p. 794. Coins of African and
Spanish colonies are extant giving to
Augusta titles formally disassowed, as
‘mater patriae' and even ‘genetrix or—

tion of construction. see Introd. v. ξ 91, 7.
15. Iuliae lius. The title ‘Divi Aug.
f.‘ is regulari borne by Tiberius on
inscriptions. For him to have also borne
his mother's name is noted by Orelli as
wholly without Roman precedent, though
an old Etruscan custom.
