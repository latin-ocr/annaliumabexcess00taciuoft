μνηστευθεΐσα, κ.τ.λ). Vergil has ‘divae
Veneris nurus ' (Aen. 2, 787).

2. itum in sententiam. That this
did not always imply unanimity‚ appears
here and m 14 49, 1

3. Rubelli Blandi: see on 6. 27,1.
According to Borghesi (see H enzen, Inscr.
p. 406) he was cos. suff. with Annius
Pollio (cp. C. 1. L. iv. 1552) during the
last six months of this year: see c. 51, 1.

aqua atque igni arcebatur. Although
the confiscation of property usually in-
volved in such a sentence was here re-
mitted‚ the penalty was otherwise more
severe than that of the ‘lex Iulia de
adulteriis’ (see on 2. 50, ¹4), and equiva-
lent to that usually inflicted for ‘ maiestas ’
(c. 50, 6). A similar severe sentence for
adultery is noted in 4. 42, 3.

4. Scauro. As no other name is
mentioned, he must be the same spoken
of in 1. 13, 4, ete. He must have mar-
ried her after her divorce from Quirinius.

5. datum ne bona publicarentur.
This act would again show that Tiberius
was ‘firmus adversum pecuniam,’ and
makes against the imputation of Sue-
tonius (Tib. 49), that he had procul-ed
the condemnation of Lepida to please
QuiriniuS, who was rich and ehildless.

tum demum, etc. It would ap ear
that the slaves of Quirinius had een
examined privately by Tiberius ; but only
those of Lepida at the public trial. It

does not necessarily follow that the evi-
dence of the latter had not already
established the charge ospoisoning. Stahr
strangely here refers ‘eum’ to Tiberius
himself, and draws inferences from it as
to his clemency.

9. solacio adfecit. Nipp. notes that j
‘ solari' or ‘consolari’ often take an ac- ³
cusative of that for which consolation is ’
given, as in 2. 36, 33 16. 13, 6; also in
Cic, as ‘consolatur honestas egestatem’
pro Quint 15, 49.

11. repetam. This verb is used of a ,,
narrative going back over the past, asin
c. 33, 1· , 12. 62, 1.

in rem publicam: cp. 1. 8, 7.

12. filiae ac neptis, the two ‘Iuliam'
see on 1. 53,1·,.4 71, 6. By‘ morte' 11(τῖΞ
refers to Iulus Antonius (1.10‚3); by
‘’fuga (‘ banishment‚' as in 14. 64, 5, ete)
to Silanus.

15. violatae maiestatis: see on 2.
5o,1. ’
16. egrediebatur. His own law, the ff..

‘lex Iulia de adulteriis? prescribed ιιι1ῑείει1ἒξ1
penalties than those which he thus arbi-⁴ ι
trarily inflicted. On the accus. with this}
verb, cp. 1. 3ο, 2, etc.

promise, nor the earlier one given in Η.
1. 1, 5, to write the history of Nerva and?
Trajan, appears to have been sulfilled.
