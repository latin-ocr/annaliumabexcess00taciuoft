their frontier at the ‘agger’ (c. 20, 2), and
⁷· they are named among the conquered na-
tions (e. 41, 2). Hence Pfitzner (p. 157),
who accepts the emendation of Nipp. on
. e. 8, 4, objects to it here and in c. 24, 5,
3 and believes that Germanicus thus secured
3388 mbmission of this people through
stennius, while himself encamped on

vius, on Verg. G. 1, 43, as stating that

mouth each, during which it was said to
be ‘novusss ‘adultus,’ or ‘praeceps‘ The

are said mediately to move the sea: on

found in Sall. Jug. 69, 2 (‘effusum op-

12. regimen, ‘the steering:' used of
the rudder itself by Ovid (M. 11, 552),

Tacitus, is previously almost confined to
poets and Livy.

(22. 19, 8), in describing a scene os con·

those of the interior to the south. N ipp.
