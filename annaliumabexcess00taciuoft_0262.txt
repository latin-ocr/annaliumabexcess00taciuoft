1. Iam Stertinius, ete. It is sug-
gested by Nipp. that, as this officer usually
commands cavalry and light troops (see
on c. 60, 4), the ‘ pars equitum‚’ mentioned
in c. 63, 5, were led by him, and aster
their retreat execute this service, advane—
ing from, and returning to K'oln. It is
perhaps more likely that we have here
some account of they other‘ pars equitumss
who are otherwise unnoticed.

Segimerum. Vell (2118, 2) gives
this name also to the father of Arminius.
On the family, see notes on c. 55, 57.

2. filium. Strabo (7. 1, 4, p. ²9²) gives
his name as Σεσίθακος, and that of his
wife as Ῥαμῖς, Οὐκρομίρου θυγάτηρ, ἦγε·-
μὸνος xii-rrum. Ἀκτουμέρου has been sug-
gested as a correction (see 1 1. 16, 2).

chief officers abroad, as on the nobility in
old times at Rome (see on 4. 63, 3).
Military hospitals, or ‘valetudinaria ' are
mentioned (Veg. 2. 10, etc.), and legions
had their ‘medici ' (cp. Inser. Orell. 448,
3508}; but from what date appears un-
certam.

1 1 . sibique et. proelio firmabat ; ⁸ sibi
firmare ' (‘ to secure to oneself’) is used
in 3. 603 H. 5. 4, 1. Here, the double
application involves a zeugma.

1 2. triumphalia insignia. The regular
phrase in inscriptions (e.g. Henzen, Index,
p. 1503 Wilmanns, Index, p. 609) is ‘ trium-
phalia ornamenta ;’ and the term is thus
analogous to that of ‘ consularia orna·
menta’ (bestowed fro'm the time of the
dictator Caesar: cp. Suet. Jul. 76), and
others, signisying that the dignity and in·

nomen patris

signia of an office were given without the
office itself. Thus, without an actual
triumph, persons were entitled to be

data utrique venia, facile Segimero, cunc- 2

called · triumphales’ (3. 30, 4, etc), and γε

to ennoble their family by ‘laureatae
statuae ' (4. 23, ι). Some suppose this
minor honour to have been first given to
Tiberius (Suet. Tib. 9). The full honour
of the ‘iustus triumphus‚' though sreely
given during at least the earlier part of
the rule of Augustus (Suet. Aug. 38), is
ever afterwards, probably from 740, B c.
14 (see Dio, 54. 24, 8), reserved sor the
imperial family: see c. 55, 1, etc.

Δ. Caecinae, 1.. Apronio, Ο. Silio.

The selection appears to be grounded

on rank (these three legati alone being.

consulars); for the personal service of
Silius is numentioned, and that recorded
of Apronius (c. 56, 1) trivial. The award,
as that in c. 55, 1, shows that the success
of the army was exaggerated at Rome.

(Juv. 8, 243), and in 709, Rc. 45, to
Julius Caesar (App. B. C. 2. 106), was
formally accepted by Augustus, from the
united voice os senate knights, and people,
on Feb. 5, 752, 13..c 2 (see Mon. ·.Ane vi.
54, and Mommsen, ad loc.); but had
probably been informally used much
earlier (cp. Hor. Od. 1. ω, 50). The
case of Cicero negatives the supposition
of Dio (53. 18, 3), that some recognition
of a general ‘patria potestas ’ was im·
plied in it. Tiberius persisted in his re-
fusal (2. 87, 2 ; Dio, 58. 12, 8); and the
title is absent from his coins and inscrip-
tlons.
