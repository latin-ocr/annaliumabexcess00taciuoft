10. in contione, i.e. in edict.

11. altius metuens: c'p. ⁶ altior pavor’
(16. 29, l), and note on 1. 32, 7. His
reply shows that he understood the irony
of c. 40, 7, ete.; and he beseeches Tibe-
rius not to harbour suspicion against him,
or listen to idle tales and malignant at-
tacks on him. On ‘tacita suspicionum‚'
see Introd. v. ξ 32 b.

¹3- in domum. Nipp. rightly takes
this closely with ‘adsiduos‚’ ‘streaming
into his house? Seneca, under similar
circumstances, discontinued such recep-
tions: see 14. 56, 6.

18. per milites. The ‘speculatores‚‘
among other duties‚ appear to have been
the ‘tabellarii’ of the princeps (Suet.
Cal. 4).

coffnmearent, sc. ‘litterae.’ The
verb is generally used of persons, but also
of ‘sermones' (2. 28, 2), ‘navis’ (Cic.
Verr. 2. 5, 18, 46), etc.

vergente senecta.. Nipp. shows
that this is abl. abs. and not depending
on ‘mollitum.' The retirement would
cooperate with the consciousness of sail-
ing power by enervating him. Walther
appears right in understanding ‘vergens
senecta‘ like ‘provecta senectus‘ (1. 4,
2), and as a stronger term than ‘vergens
