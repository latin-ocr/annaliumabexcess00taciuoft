CORNELII TACJTI ANNALIUM [A. U. C. 769.

tati0; scuta tantum lectissimis coloribus
distinguunt’ G. 6, 2. Orelli traces in
this the origin of the mediaeval devices
on shields.

1. utcumque, ‘somehow3’ i. e. the
lances, such as they were (their defects
having been already noted), were con-
fined to the front rank. The word is
here best taken closely with ‘ hastatam ;’
as in 12. 51, 2 (⁴ primam utcumque fugam
. . . toleravit ')‚ with ‘ toleravit. Its use
in this way, as limiting a verb or par-
ticiple, is especially frequent in Livy (e. g.
2 . 15, 1 .

92. braida. These would 'be the ‘fra-
meae' described in G. 6, 1, as ‘angusto
et brevi ferro,' and as the German general
weapon sor distant and close fighting.
The ‘praeusta tela’ would have no iron
head at all.

corpus: see below, c. 21, 1, and the
description in G. 4, 1 ‘omnibus truces
et caerulei oculi, rutilae comae, magna
corpora et tantum ad impetum valida!
The military qualities of the Gauls are
similarly described in Liv. 5. 44, 4 ς 10.
28, 2.

3. sine pudore, etc. To give way
before a direct attack was part os their
regular tactic (G. 6, 6); but the chival-
rous courage of at least the chiefs and
their ‘comitatus ' is celebrated (Id. 14, 2).

4. adversis, inter secunda. The
interchange of prepositional clauses with
simple cases is very common in Tacitus.
Most commonly the dative is so inter-
changed (e. g. c. 6, 4; 4. 2, 1; 46, 4;
11. 21, 4, etc.: cp. Dr. Synt. und Stil,
5 105), but probably here Nipp. is right
in taking ‘adversis' as an abbreviated

abl. abs. akin to those noted in Introd. v.
5 31. He considers this also the proper
explanation of ‘firmus adversis’ Agr. 35,
4Οέ ‘sperat infestis, metuit secundis ¹ Hor.

. 2. 10, ¹3- · -

5. viarum ao maris: one of the few
direct reminiscences of Horace apparent
in Tacitus: see Introd. v. §. 97.

7. ultra.. Nipp. thinks this alludes to
the neutral or friendly attitude of Maro·-
boduus and the Suevi beyond the Elbe
(see c. 44, etc.). It might also be meant
that no resistance could remain if they
crushed the force now opposed to them. ‘

patris patruique. Drusus had reached
the Elbe in 745, B.c. 9 (D'io, 55. 1, 2);
and Tiberius in 758, A. D. 5 (Vell. 2. 106,
2). Onthe use of ‘patrui’ here, see on.
1. 33, 3· ,

8. sisterent: cp. ‘ut eum 1n Syria . . .
sisterent’ H. 2. Χ9, 2, and the uses in
Vergil, as ‘o qui me . . . sistat' G. 2,
488; ‘te limine sistam‘ Aen. 2, 62ος

11. hos esse . . . fugacissimos. There

were some survivors of that disaster in A
the present army (cp. 1. 61, 6); and the. fs
preservation of the reserve force of two 7
legions under Asprenas (Vell. 2. 120, 1) j·
