CORNELII TACITI ANNALIUM [A. U.C.773.

prospectari poterat, maerentium turba et rogitantium inter se,

silentione an voce aliqua egredientem exciperent.

constabat quid pro tempor-e foret, cum classis paulatim successit,
non alacri, ut adsolet, remigio, sed cunctis ad tristitiam com-

positis.

postquam duobus cum liberis, feralem urnam tenens,5

egressa navi defixit oculos, idern omnium gemitus3 neque dis-
cerneres proximos alienos, virorum feminarumve planctus, nisi
quod comitatum Agrippinae longo maerore sessum obvii et

recentes in dolore anteibant.

tratus Calabriae Apulique et Campani suprema erga memoriam

filii sui munia fungerentur.

umeris cineres portabantur3 praecedebant incompta signa, versi
fasces3 atque ubi colonias transgrederentur, atrata plebes, tra-

ima litorum' H. 3. 42. 1. The instances
cited by Walther and Orelli do not war-.-
rant our explaining this text otherwise
(see Ritter); and the emendation ‘mari ’
(Muret.) is not generally accepted, though
giving a sense certainly best suited to the
context.

quaque, etc„ ⁸ places commanding the
furthest sea-view) It appears better to
take ‘ qua ² thus, with the force of ‘unde,'
than to understand the words to mean the
furthest points which a spectator from the
ships could see.

3. quid pro tempore foret, ‘ which
course was appropriate,' i. e. suitable to
the occasion: cp. ‘ pro opibus' (c. 2, 2);
‘ consilium pro tempore et pro re' (Caes.
B. G. 5. 8, 1), etc. On the use of ⁶ quid‚’
cp. 1. 47, 2. ’

successit, ‘approached.'
does not appear to be elsewhere used in
this sense absolutely, but usually with
‘ad,’ or with dat.

5. duobus: see on 2. 70, 2.

6. defixit, sc. ‘in terram.’ This mean-

This attitude of sorrow here gives the sig-
nal for the outburst of sympathy.

8. obvii et recentes in dolore.
⁸ Obvii ’ is opposed to the ⁴ comitatus.’
‘Recentes in dolore,’ ‘those whose grief
was fresh,’ an expression found in Auct.
ad Herenn. 2, 7, but not to be consound-
ed with ‘recens dolore’ (1. 41, 5). ‘Et‘
is explanatory, as the persons coupled are
the same.

The word

9. anteibant: referring to the ‘gemi-
tus‘ and ‘ planetus ’ mentioned above.

10. magistratus, sc. ‘municipales’ On
the variation from the genitive ‘Cala-
briae’ to adjectives, cp. 2. 3, 2.

11. erga: see on 2. 2, 5.

12. munia. This correction os the MS.
‘munera ¹ (apparently also necessary in
H. 3. 13, 1) is adopted by Halm and
Nipp. after Ritter: who shows, by a large
collection of instances, that in the nom.
and acc. plur-al, where Tacitus has the
choice between ‘munera’ and ‘munia,‘
he keeps them for distinct significations,
using the former for giftS, etc. (e. g. 4. 26,

ter sor duties or functions (e. g. 1. 2, 1 ς
11,3; 16, 2; 31, 33 69, 2,etc.).

fungerentur: cp. 4. 38, 1. Elsewhere
the accus. with this verb is chiefly anti-
quated, except as implied in gerundive
constructions. In these two places, it is
perhaps preserved as an archaic purism of
Tiberius.

13. incompta, ‘unadorned:' cp. ‘in-
honora signa‘ (H. 4. 62, 4), and note on
1. 24, 4. Pliny (N. H. ¹3- 3, 4, 23) notes
that the standards were anuinted with
perfume on sestal occasions.

14. fasces. The twelve denoting the
rank of Germanicus (see on 2. 53, 3).
On this sign of mourning. cp. Epiced.
Drusi 142 ‘quos primum vidi fasces, in
funere vidi, et vidi versos indiciumque
mali.' The reversal of arms in sign of
mouming is described in Verg. Aen. 11,
