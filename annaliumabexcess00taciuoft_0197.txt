2. inani rumore, ‘¹ id

regularly held from 743, B.c. 11, is ex-
plained with probability by Nipp. as a
confusion of these games with those
held on the birthday of Augustus, Sept.

confusion being clearly apparent in Dio

similar double construction is used with

5. tribuni plebei. Dio (56. 46, 4)
connects the selection of the tribunes
for this duty with the sanctity of their

Oct-9(Kal. Ant.), or Oct. 12 (Kal. Maff.):

narily the ⁶ sella curulis‚’ its symbol and
survival (Mommsen, staatsr. i. p. 377,
379); and would therefore naturally be
out of place for tribunes. Ι “

9. annua. This or ‘ annuum ’ aremar-
ginal corrections of the MS. ‘annin' In
either case the word appears superfluous3
and it is suggested with probability by
Nipp. that the text presewes part of a
marginal note which had explained ‘ mox’
by ‘ post annum.'

10. evenisset, sc. ‘ sorte : ’ ‘ obvenire’
is thus used 3. 33, 1; 4. 56, 3; Agr. 6, 43
and both verbs thus by Livy, etc.

11. Hio . . . status erat. An important
date in connection with this mutiny is sur-
nished by the eclipse (see c. 28, 1) which
marks its close. Though the precise lo-
cality of the ⁴ castra aestiva' is unknown,
some inference as to the rapidity of corn-
munication within the empire may still
