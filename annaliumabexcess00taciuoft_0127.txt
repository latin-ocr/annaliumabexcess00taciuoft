,with them that we find both rewarded with the ‘ civitas ‘ aster twenty-six
ryears' service ¹. The ships are usually either ‘ triremes ' or ‘ Liburnae ζ’
and are distinguished by names like modern ships ³. The captains,
whether of triremes or Liburniam, are designated as ‘trierarchi ⁴.' We
have no knowledge of the strength of these fleets ; which are little men-
tioned in general, but acquire some prominence in the civil war of 822,
Aa). 69. ,
Various auxiliary fleets, whether of ships of war ⁵ or transports ⁸,

⁷ existe‘d in the provinces, and are mentioned in various inscriptions ⁷.
The total strength of all these forces can be only very roughly esti-
ῑ mated. Taking the legion with its auxiliaries at 10,ooo, we have a total

of 250,ooo for the main armies; to which the home army, the ‘clas-

siarii‚' and all the various detached forces may add a further total of
A 100,000. This it should be remembered represents at that time the

whole military and naval force of the civilised world.

CONSOLIDATION or THE EMP1RE.

Augustus is said to have bequeathed at his death not a mere aggregate
of territories‚ but an organized whole ⁸. The administration‚ especially
of the provinces and armies, was centralised in a way previously unknown,
and the improvement of roads ⁹ aild'i'nstitution of copriers ¹⁰ gave new
ε rapidity to inter-communication: and, not to speak of his periodical
financial statements ¹¹, his summary of the whole position of the empire,
published after his death ¹², must have given to the senate a new insight
into its organization. If, beyond this, neither he nor his successor had
’ devised any plans for bringing the whole mass into a condition of homo-
· geneous unity; it is none the less evident that tendencies in this direction
ξ were constantly operating. The practical recognition of common inter-
ἰ ests between rulers and ruled; the security of traffie; the vast require-
