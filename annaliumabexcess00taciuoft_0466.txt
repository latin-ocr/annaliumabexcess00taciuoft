1. Apicio. Dio (57. 19, 5) gives the
name as Μάρκος Γάβιος Ἀπίκιος. He is
repeatedly mentioned in literature as the
great epicure of his age; but as Athenaeus
(1. 7, d; 4. 168, d) mentions two other
gourmands of the name, of much earlier
and later date respectively, it would seem
that the name had passed on as a ‘ sou-
briquet’ from the first of them. See
Prof. Ramsay in Dict. of Biog.

2. veno dedisse. This construction,
only found here, is analogous to ‘dono
dareL' The dative ‘veno ' appears to be
peculiar to Tacitus (cp. 13. 51, 1 ; 14. 15,
3), as ‘ venui’ to Appuleius.

3. obscurum, ‘ reserved:' cp. Cic. Off.
3. 15, 5 ; Hor. Ep. 1. 18, 94, etc.

intectum; cp. 2. 59, 2: in this sense

in Colum.; but the usage is analogous to
many others (Introd. v. ξ 34 e). In the
whole passage, Tacitus has evidently
i(n view Sallust's description of Catiline

Cat. 5).

7. obtegens: cp. 1. 76, 23 used with}
gen. here only3 but analogously to th<
usage with other participles (Introd. v.
