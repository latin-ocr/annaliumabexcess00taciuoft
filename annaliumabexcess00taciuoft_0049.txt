pt a 'distance the last pungent epigram, or glowing poetic passage.
⁸For poetic grace is now demanded of the orator, not marred with
the rust of Accius or Pacuvius, but fresh from the treasury of Horace,
of Vergil, or of Lucan ¹.' Tacitus was thus under influences both
general or literary and also special or professional‚ in adopting the
¹ poetica! colouring so characteristic of him ; but it is perhaps due to
⁴individual taste that the poetical element in his writings is almost
,s wholly-Vergilian ².

''Besides carrying much of his habitual style into the composition of
history, he evidently studied, as modes of historical writing‚ his chief
predecessors in that field, for whom he expresses such genuine ad-
miration. Of this kind, the chief influence on him known to us, is
that of Sallus-tmand Livy, who, though rarely expressly mentioned ⁸,
leave their traces in a number of forms of expression throughout his
‘fwritingsfi the former being naturally his model of terseness, the latter
of eloquepce3 with his own taste to blend and modify them.

ᾖ He has himself told us of his own painful consciousness of the dull
Jmonotony and repulsive sadness of great part of his narrative, compared
‘Qwith the range of subject and free treatment of the old “historians ⁶.
3Hence,1n the true skill of an advocate with a tedious case, he would
{the more studiously seek to create variety, and stimulate the flagging
{interest of the reader, even by ever so short an episode⁶3 by a· de-
ῘζΡαηιπε from his usual order of narrative⁷; by multiplying, artificially
Ja'nd even fancifully‚ the expressions for constant occurrences⁸‚ by a
ssfhundred small variations in the structure or arrangement of sentences⁹3
by straining more and more after novelties, or by occasionally reviving
archaisms in vocabulary or phrase ¹⁰, by anything to break the weary

ξωωεηεεε of his chronicle of tyranny.
