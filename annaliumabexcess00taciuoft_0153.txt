CHARACTER AND GOVERNMENT OF TIBERIUS. 135

between a timid or cautious foreign policy and a career of conquest ;
possibly even between a prince beyond all others parsimonious in build-
ing ¹, and the grand architectural achievements of Trajan. Other con-
trasts were ready to hand within the work itself, helping him to set off&

. the qualities of Tiberius by the idealised virtues of Germanicus ², or even

by the character of the hasty and passionate but not ungenerous Drusus⁸.'

Still, when all this is allowed for, much remains. The stages and
periods of change noted by Tacitus can be on the whole made out,
though we should consider the explanation put into the mouth of Arruntius,
that the character of Tiberius ‘ had been thrown off its balance by the
force of despotism ⁴,' to be nearer the truth than the theory adopted by
the historian as his own, that of a true character asserting itself by slow

,e'degrees against the disguise of hypocrisy ⁶.

¹ . We have on the whole the character of a prince whose friends might

J well have written ‘infelix vitae diuturnitate ⁶,’ upon his epitaph. Had he
Α died in the lifetime of Augustus, general opinion would have pronounced

him ‘imperii capax! At the end of eight years’ rule he would have left ε
aname among the best princes of the second rank. Even at seventy his -
memory would have escaped the worst stains cast upon it. Yet, had he
lived up throughout to the level of his best time, his want of originality
and sels-reliance, his pedantic adherence to the ideas of his predecessor⁷,
would have made it no more than a period of good administration withou;
advance ; and a rule which in duration is equalled by none till Antoninus
Pius, and exceeded by none till Constantine, would probably have been
barren of historical interest. To waive all comparison with the great
names of Roman Imperialism, even a much weaker ruler, Claudius, has
left his mark more on the history of the empire. Nor is a change of
character, even late in lise, in his case difficult to explain. At the best·
his virtues were those of the subject or subordinate ruler rather than o
the autocrat; and the principate found him timid, irresolute, and self

’ distrustfu1‚ when he had no superior to rely upon. Hence the necessit
Δ always, in estimating his conduct, to allow for the influence of some

*stronger will, such as the imperiousness of his mother, or the erasto
.Seianus; and hence, when all these were removed, the neglect even o ,
