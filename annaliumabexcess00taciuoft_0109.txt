ROME UNDER Α UG USTUS AND TIBERIUS. 9 1

Under these were grouped the 265 ‘ vici ¹,' or quasi-parochial corporations,
choosing each their four wardens or ‘ vico-magistri ²‚' whose duties,
though mainly religious‚ were also in part constabulary ³, at least till the
institution in 756, Aa). 6, of the ‘ vigiles ⁴,' who were so distributed that
each cohort, 1000 strong, had watch and ward of two regions ⁵, to guard
from fire and robbery3 both of which were still rife enough in crowded
districts, and streets lit only by the poor passenger’s lamp-wick, and now
and then by the rich man’s torch train ⁶. Besides the ‘ vigiles,’ the urban
and praetorian guards were in reserve, if needed, and the police magis-
tracy, beyond such powers as remained to aediles and other magistrates ⁷,
tested with the city ‘praefect ⁸.

The principate of Tiberius seems on the whole to mark the period
when the populace are least considered. They take the oath of allegiancJ ’
athis accession ⁹, and then seem to retire from prominence. They have
no votes to sell ¹⁰, the general tie of clientship would thereby become
more unmeaning, and the rabble are not yet the ‘clientela Caesaris?
Their only interest is in their bread and their amusements ¹², and in both

ἶ

⁵· they seem to have their grievances. To keep famine at bay is indeed fel ἰ
v by the princeps to be his most arduous task ¹², and to require efforts f

exceeding those of Augustus ¹⁸. Still, the cry for bread, finding expression ἓ ”

.- at the great popular gatherings of the games, is fieree and even menacing¹⁴;
in the general poverty even a small tax seems burdensome¹⁵ ; and,
- beyond doing his utmost for the food supply, Tiberius keeps them at a
distance. The legacies of Augustus are paid grudginglyffi, ‘ congiaria'

ὲ.

J are infrequent 17; and, though the people have the cheap daily lounge
of their public baths, thanks to Maecenas and Agrippa, and their‘ cir-
censes 'and new ‘ludi Augustales ¹⁸ 'yet the presence of the princeps ,
3 at their games‚ if vouchsafed at all, is no longer genial¹⁹, and the sangui—
ἰ, nary excitement of gladiatorial shows so rare, that crowds flock to one
, given by private speculation in the neighbourhood ²⁰. Their moods are
J schooled ⁹¹ and 1·ebuked²²2 by edicts‚ their murmurs treated as vapour ²³,
