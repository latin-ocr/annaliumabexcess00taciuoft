Within this tract, the district afterwards known ‘as the ‘ agri decumates ’
was no doubt at this time a debateable ground ¹ ; but some such line as
that of the ‘limes' must-have been already the frontier of Vindelicia‚
until the point at which the Danube, by far the greatest river-frontier of
the Empire, forms, during the whole of its remaining course, the boundary Ι
of Vindelicia or Rhaetia, of Noricum ², of Pannonia, and of Moesia. ⁷

In Asia Minor the frontier would mainly coincide with the Halys ³ and
Mount Taurus, till the incorporation of Cappadocia and Commagene
with the provincial empire in 771, A. D. 18 ⁴, made the Euphrates a con-
tinuous frontier of these and of the province of Syria from a little above
lat. 39⁰ to about 36⁰.

From this point, neither east nor south has any such clearly marked
natural frontiers. We know that neither Palmyra ⁵ nor Petra ⁶ was within
the limits of Syria or Palestine 3 that Egypt ended at Elephantine and
Syene⁷; while the other provinces on the African continent must have
occupied generally the strip possessed in earlier times by Greek,
Phoenician‚ and Libyan, as distinct from the abode of the Aethiopian
races⁸. This portion of the empire was completed to the straits of
Gibraltar, by the addition of Mauretania in the time of Claudius ⁹.

Besides the many acts of Augustus, in respect of the aequisifion,
extension, consolidation‚ and regulation of provinces3 by far the most
important change dating from his time is the division of the provincial
empire between himself and the senate ¹⁰. Out of the distinct govern-
ments, about thirty in number ¹¹, subsisting at his death, only the following,
and these not at all times, remain inthe hands of the senate: 1. Sjfflly;
2. Sardinia and Corsica ¹² ; 3. Hispania Baetica 3 4. Gallia Narbonensis;
5. Mace-donia3 6. Aclhqaia¹³; 7. Asia ; 8. Bithynia (with part os Western
Pontus); 9. Cyprum 10. Crete and Cyreri'aica145 11. Afflfgicar.(xvith New
