Twelve Tables will be found in Arnold‚
Hist. vol. i. c. 14. In its general cha-
racter, this, like the early codes of other
nations‚ was probably a natural con-
sequence of the diffusion of the art of
writing, leading to a demand for such
engraved tablets, published and accessible
to all, in place of customary law, known
only to privileged exponente. It was thus
more probably grounded on existing
usages than an' eclectic code (⁶ accitis quae
usquam egregia ¹) ; but some evidence sor
the tradition that its framers had studied
contemporary Greek models may be found
in its arrangement, apparently more sys-
tematic than that of other early codes:
see Maine, Anc. Law, ch. i. esp. pp.
14, 15.

1. finis aequi iuris, ‘the close of
equitable law.' That such is the meaning
of Tacitus would appear from the follow-
ing sentence, stating that the subsequent
course os legislation, except such as was
directed to the repression of crime, aimed
at personal or party objects‚ rather than
the welsare of the whole state. It is easy
to point to laws which cannot be justly
so described; and Tacitus may have
really meant no more than that the
enactment of this code' was the last
occasion on which all orders had united
in a comprehensive attempt at legislation.
He appears to know nothing of the dis-
tinction implied in the narrative of Livy
and asserted by Cicero (de Rep. 2. 37,
63), that the two last Tables were ‘ini-
quissimae' The genera-l Roman reve·-
rence sor the code is expressed by Cicero,
and also by Livy, who calls the first ten
Tables ‘fons omnis publici privatique
iuris' (3. 34, 7). The division of periods
is here obscure; sor the conflict of pa-
tricians and plebeians (cp. ‘dissensione
ordinum et apiscendi illicitos honores’)
belongs to the century immediately suc-
ceeding the decemvirate, while some of

” the remarks on the ⁴ secutae leges ' appear

to refer to later dates than even that of
the Gracchi, and ‘ alia prava ' might have
very wide reference.

in maleficos. This might refer to
old laws ‘de ambitu;' to the ‘lex Fabia
de plagiariis* in 571, B. c. 183; the ⁴ lex
Calpurnia de repetundis' in 605, B.C.
149 (omitting later laws).

2. ex delicto, ⁶ according as crimes
arose:’ cp. ‘ex re’ (1. 24, 1), etc.

dissensione ordinum, causal ab1.:
cp. c. 26, 2, and references there. The
‘lex Canuleia de co'nnubio ordinum'
would be an instance, as also those open-
ing the magistracies; the words ‘ et
apiscendi‚’ etc. being explanatory of,
rather than distinct from, ‘dissensione
ordinum.'

3. apiscendi inlicitos honores. This
construction, so frequent with the gerun-
dive (Introd. v. ξ 37 d), is rare with the 1
gerund. The laws referred to are those
opening the various magistracies to ple-
beians, as the Licinian rogations (Liv. 6.
ῗὲἕῶἒῑέ»ῙῖῗᾱῗῖἐῗἚῙ-ῗ).(Ιὲῐηῖᾱὲἰέἢὲἓὲ
of Tacitus for the later aristocracy leads
him even to sympathise with the struggle
of the patriciate against the plebeian}
houses. Livy also at times speaks of the .
old plebeians as if they were a rabblei
