1. consultum esset: so Halm and
Nipp. after Muretus, for the MS. ‘est ς’
which others, with Otto, alter to ‘sit.’
Pfitzner's defenoe of ‘est’ (p. 137) as a
quotation of the exact words of Tiberius,
appears to contain no sufficient explana-
tion of such an insertion.
“ internis discordiis. As an illus·
tration of this, may be quoted the hos-
v tilities between the Cherusci and Suebi in
the very next year (c. 44, 2); the plot of
the prince os the Chatti against the life of
Arminius (c. 88, 1); the massacre os the
Chatti by the Hermunduri in 811, Α. D.
58 (13. 57); t'most complete des-
truction of the cteri by their neigh-
, bours, and subjection of the Cherusci by
the Chatti, at the date of the ‘ Germania '
(G. 33. 1; 36, 1)-
3. praesens, 1. e. at Rome. He had
ἔξω consulship, but in absence (c. 53,
, 4. adnectebat. This verb here, and in
4. 28. 2. has the construction of ‘ addere.’
6. nomen imperatorium: see on 1. 3,
t, etc. Drusus never received this title.
7. deportare lauream, ‘to earn the
burel wrenth? so ‘deportare triumphum ‘

, before the accession of Tiberius (Suet. Tib.
3 ¹Ut»)- Velleius (ει. 129, 130) and Suetonius
(1.1.) appear to view him as a more formid-
able conspirator. The kalendar of Amiter-

de salute Ti. Caes. liberorumque eius et
aliorum principum civitatis inita.' Seneca
(Ep. 70, ιο) describes him as ⁶ adoles-
cens tam stolidus quam nobilis, maiora
sperans quam illo seculo quisquam sperare
poterat aut ipse ullo! Dio (57. 15, 4)
speaks os him only ⁵ as δόξαντά τι νεωτε·

detailed charges are specified, and the
whole shown to shrink into mere ques-
tions of astrology and magic.

Libo Drusus. The kalendar cited
above oells him ‘M. Libo ;' Suet. (ll.)
oells him ‘ L. Scribonius Libo; ’ consusing
him apparently with the consul of this
year (c. ς, 1), supposed to be his brother

( 11? defertur moliri. The infin. with
this verb (as 3. 22, 1: 6. 19, 1; 13. 23,1)
and other verbs of accusing is especially
common in the Annals: see Introd. v.
ξ 45. Dr. notes as precedents its use with
‘ convincor ’ by Liv. (45. 10, 14), and
with ‘arguor’ and ‘insimulor' by Cic.
(Rosc. Am. 13, 37; Verr. 2. 2, 24, 59,
etc.). Cic. does not however say in this
sense ‘ deferre aliquem ' (as in 13. 33, 3.
etc.)‚ but ‘ alicuius nomen,’ using the verb
with a personal object only in the sense of
‘ recommending’ (as Arch. 5, 11).

res novas: cp. c. 78, 13 3. 13, 3;

specific than that of ⁸ maiestas)
