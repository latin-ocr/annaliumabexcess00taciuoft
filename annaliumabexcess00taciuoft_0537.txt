ξ 1 66. Sed ut studia procerum et largitio principis adversum
casus solacium tulerant, ita accusatorum maior in dies et infestior
vis sine levamento grassabatur: corripueratque Varum Quin-
tilium, divitem et Caesari propinquum, Domitius Afer, Claudiae
Pulchrae matris eius condemnator, nullo mirante quod diu egens 5
et parto nuper praemio* male-usus plura ad flagitia accingeretur.

claris maioribus et Varo conexus suam ipse nobilitatem, suum

in tempus erat.

67. At Caesar dedicatis per Campaniam templis, quamquam
edicto monuisset ne quis quietem eius inrumperet, concursusque
oppidanorum disposito milite prohiberentur, perosus tamen muni-
cipia et colonias omniaque in continenti sita, Capreas se in
insulam abdidit, trium milium freto ab extremis Surrentini pro-

to a less strong position.
§3133 ‚studia procerum, referring to c.
Ξ. Varum Quintilium. M. Seneca
(Contr. 3, 10) mentions him as having
been twitted by Cestius (cp. 6. 7, 3) in a
declamauon with being son of the Varus
stain in Germany. He is also there called
s Germanici gener et praetextatus3' but it
us not known to what daughter of Ger-

. manicas he was betrothed.

4· caesari propinquum. The rela-

ἰ tionship through his mother Claudia

Pulchra (see c. 52, 1) would be but dis-

'3 stant3 yet no other appears to be known.
= ἡ Domitius Afer: see e. 52, 1.

5. condemnator, i. e. who had pro-
cured her condemnation (cp. ‘damnasset '

3. 36. 3). The word occurs only here and
in Tert. adv. Marc. 2, 9.

6. praemio, the accuser's usual reward:

ep. c. ιο, 3.

7. Publium Dolabellam: see on 3.
47, 4. His relationship to Varus has not
been tmoed.

8. clu-is maioribus, abl. of quality.

9. perdstum ibam a phrase taken

stom Plaut. (Aul. 4. 10, 10, etc.)‚ Sall.

(cat. 36. 4, etc.)‚ and others. Tacitus uses

other similar constructions, as ‘raptum,’
‘ ultum ire' (c. 1, 2; 73, 6, etc).

1 1. in tempus, ⁴ temporarily:' cp. 6. 1 1,
1. For slightly different uses of the
phrase, cp. 1. 1, 1, etc.

12. dedicatis . . . templis: cp. c, 57, 1.
On the force of ‘ per‚' see Introd. v. ξ 62.

13. eius. According to classical usage
‘suam’ would have been expected (cp.
‘ edicto vetuit ne quis se praeter Apellem
pingeret’ Hor. Ep. 2. 1, 239): Nipp.
compares ‘ut eum . . . sisterent orabat ’
H. 2. 9, 2.

inrumperet, ‘break in upon: ’ see
note on 2. 11, 4. In H. 5. 22, 5 Tacitus
has ‘ne quietem eius turbarent,’ and it
has been thought that this or ‘ interrum-
peret' (Ritt.‚ after Her.) should be read
here. It is not impossible, as Pfitzner
(p. 64) suggests, that the words are quoted
from the edict: nor, if they are those of
Tacitus, are they unsupported by paral-
lels (cp. H. 1. 82, 1; 4. 50, 2).

14. municipia. et colonias: see 1. 79,1.

15. Capreas . . . in insulam: cp. ‘ Hi-
beros ad patrium regnum' 12. 51, 4,
‘Geldubam in castra ’ H. 4. 32, 2. Taci-
tus correctly gives the distance os Capri
from the nearest point of land; Pliny
states it at eight miles from Surrentum
itself, and estimates the circumference of
the island at eleven miles. Augustus had
made it his property in 725, ac, 29
(Strab. 5. 4, 8, ²⁴8³ Dio, 52. 43, 2 ; Suet.
Aug. 9²) by giving to the community of
