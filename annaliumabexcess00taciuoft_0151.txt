CHA RA C TER AND GO VERNMEN T OF TIBERIUS. 1 3 3

nineteen had almost saved Rome from famine as quaestor¹; and at
twenty-five had virtually subjected Armenia and terrified Parthia² ; we
are forced to ask how much similar exaggeration may lurk in the history
of the German and Illyrian campaigns, Sometimes, too, this rhetoric is
confronted by stubborn realities. Against the alleged all but complete
subjugation of Germany ³, must be set the fact, that the single defeat and

. annihilation of a force of some 30,000 men rolled back the tide of con-

quest from Germany, not temporarily, but for ever. The account of the
passionate enthusiasm, with which the legions are said to have welcomed
Tiberius on his return ⁴, must be read in the light of our knowledge that
his name ten years later had assuredly no magio, either for veteran or
recruit‚ among the armies that had known him best. Even Julius Caesar
had to sace the mutiny of a legion; but popular generals have not often
been met by the wholesale defection of their armies ⁶.

In the notice by Velleius of this principate, we have no right to expect
details from a sketch of sixteen years contained in eight chapters 3 yet his

’ suppressions at times are most significant. Four years had passed since

Tiberius had permanently left Rome⁶5 yet his retirement is not even
glanced at. On all the state trials of these yearS, we have only a line
in reproach of the crimes of Libo Drusus, Cn. Piso, and Silius 3 and a
hint of the shame and sorrow supposed to have been felt at the conduct
of Agrippina and Nero ⁷, We seem forced to conclude that on these
subjects the silence of Velleius is more eloquent than the epigrams of
Tacitus. Are we prepared, again, to take his verdict on Seianus as well
as on his master? to see in him the Laelius to this Scipio, the Agrippa
or Statilius Taurus to this Augustus⁸? The impression left upon us
becomes on the whole that of a fairly skilful apology, saved from palpable
falsehood by ignoring what it is difficult to defend‚,-and laying stress
upon what is undeniably praiseworthy.

On other authors less need here be said. No critic will expect to find
truth of value in the few scattered allusions of Valerius Maximus ⁹. Philo,

it must be borne in mind, has a purposffto serve, in setting off a special

JV grievance by a contrast of general beneficence of imperial government¹⁰.
