12. simplicius acturum, 'he would
deal more frankly‘ (see on 1. 69, 4), i. e.
he would not leave his disapprobation to
be inferred from an evasive answer.

13. si matrimonium . . . distraxisset.
Nipp. explains this to mean that, while
Agrippina and Livia were widows, both
were equally members of the ‘domus
Caesarum) of which Tiberius was sole

Antonia and

head. The marriage of either, besides
giving her an advantage over her rival,
would create another house within a
house.

14. sic quoque, ‘ even as things were at
present:' cp. 15. 17, 3, and ‘sic melius¹

1ss {lepores suos convelli. This verb
is used of a house or family (6. 40, 3;
12. 1, 1; 65, 3) in the sense of being
shaken to its foundations by an attack or
crisis; here it is used of several persons,
probably in the sense of being ‘torn
asunder’ (ep. 1. 32, 3), i. e. no longer
united as a family. Nipp. takes it
in the sense in which it is used os
Tiberius himself in 6. 48, 4 (where see
note). 1t seems to be forgotten that
the sou of Drusus was but six years old,
