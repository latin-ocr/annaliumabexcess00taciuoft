implying that consecrated statues might

violatum periurio numen. A charge
apparently of this character (‘violatum
Augusti numen ') is afterwards more
- seriously taken up (3. 66, 2). That men
swore' by the ‘numen Augusti' in his
lifetime, appears from Hor. Epp. 2. 1, 16.
Specimens of such oaths are given by
Marquardt (Staatsxr. iii. p. 443) stom C. Ι.
L. ii. 172, and C.1. G. 1983. '

(cited by Lips.).

9. praetorem. Bithynia was governed
by senatorial proconsuls of praetorian
rank. Hence, though its governor is
properly styled ‘proconsul’ (cp. 16. 18,
3), he may be spoken of as ‘ propraetor ‘
or even ‘praetor' (cp. ‘praetorem Achaiae ’
ts? {22⁹³ {332505153395333 εὲἱξὲθρὲἰῖῗέἓ f»
‘ praetorium,’ etc.) for what appertained
to a provincial governor in general. See
Marquardt, Staatsv. i. p. 381, and note

1. notuere. This verb, frequent in the
Annals (eg. 4. 7, 2; 6. 8, ¹03· 12. 8, 3,
etc.), is one of those found in no earlier
prose (Introd. v. 5 70).

consulibus. As the praetor presided
in the law-courts, so the consuls preside
at all judicial proceedings in the senate;
on which see Introd. vi. p. 78.Ἰ

4. ludis, etc. Dio (56. 46, 5) describes
this three days’ festival held by Livia in
the Palatium, as one of the institutions at
the time of apotheosis; but the words of
Tacitus appear to imply its earlier ex‘ist-
ence. It is generally identified with the
soenic ‘ludi Palatini ’ (Suet. Cal. 56) de-
scfibed by Josephus (Ant. ¹9· 1, 13), in
his account of the assassination of Gaius
during them.

7. perinde . . . quam si: cp. 13. 49, 3.
The expression is peculiar to Tacitus, who
has also ‘perinde quam’ (6. 30, 4, etc.).
‘Perinde’ and ‘ proinde’ are often con-
fused in the MS. through abbreviations
(cp. 3. 17, 5 3 and note there).

Α 8. deorum iniurias dis eura-e. This
ψ is an old maxim os Roman Law, which

’ therefore resrained from imposing legal
perralties for pei-jury (Mommsen, Staatsr.
, li· 784). It is also laid down by later
Δ im-iats, ‘ Iurisiurandi contempta religio

ongithfiyrioiae. This province included

not only the country generally known by
that name, separated from Mysia and
Phrygia by the Rhyndacus and Olympus,
and extending eastward to the Parthenius3
but also the western part of the Pontic
kingdom, added to it by Cn. Pompeius,
and extending along the Paphlagonian
coast to the Halys, The chief towns of
Bithynia proper are N icomedeia and
Nicaea, and in the Pontic portion Amas-
tris and Sinope (the latter a colony of
Julius Caesar). The province was subse-
quently Caesarian, and much of our know·
ledge of it is derived from the correspond-
ence of the younger Pliny (Epp. 10), as its
governor, with Trajan. See Marquardt,
staatsv. i. p. 191, etc.

10. quaestor ipsius. This was con·
trary to Roman sentiment. See Cic. Div.
in Caec. 11, 18.

postulavit. The genitive with this
verb, on the analogy of ‘accuso,’ etc. is

confined to Tacitus (3. 66, 2 3 70, 2 5etc.) ⁵

and Suetonius.

subscribente. This term, in the
sense of ‘signing the accusati0n‚’ might
be used of the principal or sole accuser;
but evidently here, as in many other places,
