1.. Asprenas (cp. 1. 53, 9), and may thus
have been nearer to the actual war with
,Tacfarinas (cp. 2. 52, Ι).

1. 1.. Apronius. On his proconsulate,
epia-azggdffls: so used in H. 4. 2, 7.
'nae full expression would probably be
‘absuactus in pemiciem‚’ a figure from
³stell an expression as ‘abstrahi . . . ad
capitale supplicium' (Curt. 3. 2, 17).

3. Is quoque annus, this year, like
that preceding: cp. 3. 60-63.

‘⁴- Samiis Iunonis. Samos, made a
¹foee state by Augustus (Dio, 54, 9, 7),

m included, like the other islands, in the
province of Asia. Its Heraeum, spoken
of by Herodotus (2. 148; 3. 62) as the
grutest temple known to him, was de-
myed by the Persians, and suffered in
nhoequent wars, but was still great and
finnus as late as the time of Pausanias
(7. 4,· 4). The temple was ou the coast
near the city, and some ruins of it appear
to be found nm the modern Chora.

ocis Aesculapii. Cos was one of
the great oentres of this worship, and of
the caste or medical school of Ascle-
padue. Hippocrates himself was bom

lelund the privilege of immunity‚ mainly
fur its medical same: see 12. 61, 1.

‘6·. qua tempestate. It is implied that
the decree was of this early date. This

8. ex loco, ‘connected with the place.'

9. induxerant. This verb takes the
dat. in 5. 1, 3, etc„ also in Stat. and Suet.

cum . . . trucidarentur, in 666,
Β. c. 88: cp. Vell. 2. 18, 1. Appian
records (Mithr. 23) that many famous
sanctuaries were then violated.

11. variis . . . questibus. Riots had
taken place in former years: cp. 1. 54, 3 ;
77, 1. On the ‘ ius ludorum ’ of the prae-
tors, cp. 1. 15, 5, etc.

13. in publicum: cp. 2. 48, 1.

seditiose, foeda: cp. Dio (57. 21,
3), τάς τε γυναῖκας ἥσχυνον καὶ στάσεις
ἤγειρον. There is also abundant evidence
(cp. Suet. Tib. 45; Cal. 27; Ner. 39;
Galb. 13) that the ‘exodia' osten con-
tained pasquinades on, or covert allusions
to, the princeps.

Oscum quondam ludicrum, i. e.
the ¹ Atellanae,’ which, though not origi-
nally left to professional actors (Liv. 7.
2, 12), had now been taken up by the
‘pantomimi ; ’ sor whom, see on 1. 54 3,
and the references above given to Sue-
tonius. Strabo (5. 3, 6, 233) refers to
the survival of the Oscan dialect in the
popular mimes.

16. pulsi turn histriones Italia.
Suetonius (Tib. 37) represents this punish·

factionum et histriones propter quos dis·
sidebatur.’ Dio (1. 1.) speaks as if it was
a more general measure. One os the first
acts of Gaius was to bring them back
