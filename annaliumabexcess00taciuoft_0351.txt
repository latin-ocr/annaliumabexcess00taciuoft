name was written on a tablet, with solemn
imprecations to the infernal deities.
Several such leaden or bronze tablets have
been found, especially a number, with
, Greek inscriptions, in the ‘ temenos’ of
Demeter and other deities at Cnidus, (see
Newton, ‘ Halicarnassus, Cnidus, and
Branchidae: ii. pt. 2, pp. 719-745). A
full list of references is given in Marquardt,
staatsv. iii. p. 109: sor specimens in Latin,

generally prefers the construction with
nom. and infin. (e. g. c. 72. 2; 1. 52, 2,
etc.): cp. Introd. v. ξ 45. The expression
appears to imply that Tacitus himself
was not a sharer in this belief.

3. valetudinis adversa. rimantes,
‘prying into the bad symptoms of the
disease.’ The expression is somewhat
varied from ‘valetudine adversa' above,
and ‘ valetudo‚’ as often (cp. c. 82, 1), here

 

seeHenzen, p. ²¹9} Wilmanns 2747-2750.
Among the formulae used are ‘ Dite pater

' tibei commendo ; ’ ‘ hanc hostiam accep-

tam habeas et consumas 3' ⁸ hunc ego aput

{osu-nm numen demando devoveo desacri-
ci0‚’etc.

1. semusti„ i. e. human remains
snatched from the pile (cp. Luc. 1. 1.).
This would explain their being ‘tabo
obliti: Doed. less probably takes it to
mean ashes of the cypress or figtree, burnt
in spells (Hor. Sat. 1. 8, 24).

tabo: so most edd„ after Lips., sor the
MS. ‘ tabe3’ which Orelli retains, and
which may be shown to bear the sense
required in other writers (seeOrelli's note) ;
bnt Tacitus appears to be elsewhere care-
sul to distingmsh the words, and to use
‘tabes’ only of disease or decay(1. 53, 33
Π· ⁶. 3; 12. 50, 33 H. 1. 26, 13 4. 81,
²3 5. 3, 1), ‘tabum' of putrified animal
matter (H. 2. 70, 2 ; 3. 35, 1).

malefioa=‘res maleficae! The word
does not s'eem to be elsewhere used sub-
.8tantively for ‘ charms,’ and ‘maleficia’

, 11³⁵ the sense in Apul. (de Mag. c. 42,

495³. etc.); but the adjective is sufficiently
used of magical arts and magicians to
make the correction of Beroald. (adopted
bs Nipp.) needless.

2· ereditur. The acc. with inf. after
this passive (14. 48, 3, etc.) is frequently
used in Livy (see Nipp.) ; but Tacitus

means sickness. Such insidious visits
‚(‘ sivecura illud sive inquisitio erat ’) were
paid by emissaries of Domitian in the last
illness of Agricola (Agr. 43, 2).

4. ira quam per metum. On this
vagiation of construction, cp. Introd. v.
ξ 2.

7. liberis. The two with him (3. 1,
5) were Gaius (Suet. Cal. 10) and the
infant Julia (c. 54, 1).

8. defectum, ‘ enfeebled : ’ so ‘de-
fecto corpore ’ (4. 29, 1). The participle
is not ante-Aug„ and chiefly poetical:
cp. Ov. Met. 10, 194; Tibull. 2. 5, 75.

10. amicitiam renuntiabat. This was
a formal act, part of ancient custom, not
only between individuals (cp. 6. 29, 33
Suet. Cal. 3), but as one of the formalities
of deelaring war against states which had
been friendly (Liv. 36. 3, 8; 42. 25. 1).
When the princeps thus acted, some form
of sentence of banishment generally ac·
companied the renunciation (cp. ‘domo
et provinciis suis interdixit' Suet. Aug.
66), or was sometimes taken as tacitly
implied (3. 24, 5) : see Lips. Excursus xi.

11. iussum. It is the contention of
Piso and his friends (cp. c. 76, 1 ; 77, 1 ;
80, 35, that Tiberius alone could supersede
his own legatus. But the Subsequent
position of Piso seems to show that he
was no longer ‘de iure‘ the legatus of
Syria (cp. c. 74, 1, etc.), so that we must
