to be thought of rather than his character.

1. an Augustum, etc. The speakers
appear to exaggerate the frequency of
these expeditions, and wholly to invent the
contrast of age. We know of no later

se . . ,in casum dare„ In 12. 14,
3, Tacitus has ‘rem in casum dare 3 ' and
such phrases are analogous to ‘rem in
casum . . ,committere' (Liv. 4. 27, 6),
and ‘dare se in viam' (Cic. Fam. 14.
12), or ‘in fugam ’ (Id. Verr. 4. 43, 95).

10. subnixus, ‘ supported by:’ cp. c.
11, 3; 11. 1, 2.

quoa. The nse of this pronoun in
the sense of ‘ uter ’ is rare, but found in
the best authors: cp. ‘controversias . ..
quisnam anteferetur ’ (Caes. Β. G. 5. 44,
2); ‘quem velis, nescias,' i.e. Antonius
or Octavianus (Cic. Att. 16. 14, 1): cp.
also Cic. ad Fam. 7. 3, 13 Verg. Aen.
12, 7193 727; and several other instances
cited by Nipp.

11. ao ne. From ‘angebant’ are sup-

plied both the idea of doubt (with ‘ quos
anteferret ’), and of sear (with ‘ne . .
incenderentur ’). ‘Ac ne’ is used in H.
2. 34, 23 3. 46, 3, to subjoin an ad—
ditional motive for an action. The
original text of the MS„ ⁴ intenderentur,'
has found defenders (cp. Pfitzner, p. 45) 2
but that verb, though often used by
Tacitus in the sense of ‘to intensisy,’
appears never used with an accusative
of the person.

13. excusatum. This participial ad-
jective, in the sense of ¹ excusable,’ is post-
Augustan and rare. The adverbial com-
parative is found in 3. 68, 1, and other
adverbial or adjectival uses in Seu„
Quint. and Pl. min.

15. ut . . . itm-us. Drager notes that,
before Livy, this rendering of the Greek
