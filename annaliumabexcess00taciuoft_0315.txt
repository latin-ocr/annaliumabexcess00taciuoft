liberalitate; abst. for conen: cp.
Introd. v. ξ 1. The word is used espe-
cially by Tacitus of imperial gifts to in-
dividuals (4. 20, 1 ; H. 1. 20, 2); asalso
by Suet. (Tib. 46, ete).

deciens sestertii: see on 1.75, 5. Suet.
(Aug. 41), who seems wrong. in stating
that the senatorial census was fixed at
1,200‚000 H. S.‚ says that Augustus ⁶ sup-
plevit non habentibus.’ On the support

'ven by him and Tiberius to aristocratic
finges, see Introd. vii. p. 85; Friedl. i.
- p. ε’ .
a. loco sententiae: see c. 33, 2.
3. in Palatio. Probably in the li-
brary of Apollo, where Augustus in old
age osten held the senate (Suet. Aug. 29),

¹ and where were the medallions (‘clipe1’

, c. 83, 4) of oratum, etc.
Δ 4. eitam: cp. c. 7, 33 1. 39, 4, etc.
8. gentile . . . bonum. Nipp. notes
that the combination of ‘gentile' and
⁶ domus' (‘ the family gift of our house’)
strengthens the expression. According
to Val. Max. (8. 3, 3), the oratory of Hor-
tensius d on only to his daughter,
who once pleaded before the triumvirs
against a ‘ tributum ’ laid on matronS.
· 9. cecinere vel para-re potuissem. His
’ patemal inheritanoe was, no doubt, lost

(see above); but the change of times in-
terposed no such bar to his advancement
as is here pleaded. The tenses of ‘ po-
tuissem ’ and ‘ habebam ’ refer to the time
before his marriage, and the mood of the
former is causal»

10. satis habebam, si: so 4. 38, 1.

12. stirps. Nipp. takes this to mean
⁸ the stem ’ of future consuls, etc., in con-
trast to ‘progenies : ’ but the words are
more probably synonyms; for ‘ stirps ‘ is
used by poets, in this sense, os the ‘sci0n,’
and Tacitus seems here to be repeating
Ovid, ‘ stirps haec progeniesque mea est’
(Trist. 3. 14, 14).

tot. Among the Hortensii, one dic-
tator, the author of the ‘ Lex Hortensia '
(468, B.C. 286), one consul, the orator
(685, Rc. 69), and one cos. design. (646,
B.c. 108), can alone be found. But this
rhetorical flourish may have had further
support from the honours of other fami-
lies connected with them. The orator
had married a Lutatia and a Marcia.

ad invidiam, etc. On the variation
of construction, cp. c. 6, 4.

16. incitamentum, etc. Nipp. sees in
this mere malignity; but probably Wal-
ther is right in laying the stress on
‘ promptius-⁹ He had made up his mind,
and, seeing the sympathy of the senate,
spoke at once before it had gone too
far.
