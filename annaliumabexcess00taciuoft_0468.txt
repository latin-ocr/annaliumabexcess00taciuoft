makes the antithesis of ⁴ vis ’ and ‘ dolus ’

prominent, but owns that in any case

Ehe} crimes would require some ‘ vis
0 osa.‘

1. tamen, i. e. although it involved de-
lay. He elected to proceed by degrees
and to make Drusus the first victim‚ The
variation from a noun to an infinitive re-
sembles those noted in Introd. v. ξ 91;
and there appears to be no reason for
reading ‘ occultiore ’ with Ritter.

3. animo commotior: cp. 1. 33, 6, etc.
0611 1110 character of Drusus, cp. 1. 29, 4;

4. eontra tendentis‚‘ when he offered
resistance.¹ Dio (57. 22, 1) represents
Seianus as having struck Drusus, not in
sels-desence‚ but out of wanton .ins01ence.

5. igitur. This appears to explain,
not the choice of Drusus as first victim‚
but the ⁴ longior via ’ pursued.

promptissimum: cp. 2. 2, 6; 5, 4.

6. Liviam: cp. 2. 43, 7, etc.

7. ut, ‘as if!

8. adulterio. It seems on the whole
best to explain this, with Walther and
Ritter, as abl. instr., and to take ‘ pellexit‘
as=‘sibi devinxit‚‘ as in 1. 2, 1; H. 4.
15, 1. Others take it as a dative like
‘morti deposcit ' (1. 23, 6).

9. abnuerit, potential subjunct.

10. consortium regni. Apparently to
avoid a double genitive, the mention of
the hope is implied 111 that of the thing
hoped for; as is elsewhere the thought 111
the mention of its object (see note on 1.
41, 3), Agrippina is thus said‘ consor-
tium imperii speravisse’ (14.11,1); for

cp ‘domus regnatrix’ 1. 4, 4.

12. municipali, of Vulsinii (c. 1, 3). ι
The term implied now no inferiority of Ξ
civic status, but that a person had 1101 1
senatorial ancestors, who would have had
to live in Rome. Thus Juvenal (8, ,ἐι-3η,
