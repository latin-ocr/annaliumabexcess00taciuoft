110 INTRODUCTJON.

colonies ; must have tended, even more than the centralised government, ἱ
to level the barriers of nations. Two languages again were more and j:
more taking the place of a Babel of tongues: the prevalence of Greek J
in the East may be estimated from the extent of its use among even a
race so tenacious of nationality as the Hebrews¹ 3 while, in the West,
Latin, already prevalent in Gaul, making the vernacular forgotten in
many parts of Spain 2, and generally spoken also in Pannonia ³, was not
wholly lost even by Rome's bitterest enemies 4 ; and, as the official lan-
guage of the whole empire, had some hold even-in the East ⁵. ”
Again‚ though Tiberius probably imitated the reserve of Augustus in
bestowing the ‘ civitas θ ; ’ yet even this great equalisation of privilege must
have been steadily extending itself. By the manumission of slaves,
which, in spite of checks imposed upon it, must have been constant, any
Roman could call into existence those who at a stroke of the wand
succeeded to most⁷‚ and whose sons would sueceed to all, civic privileges.
Many a Roman pauper by transplantation to a colony became there the
parent of a prosperous civic family. Many an auxiliary soldier, already
habituated to Roman customs by service under the standards, received
the civitas on his discharge ⁸, and his sons might serve and rise in the
ranks of the legions and thus lay the foundation of a career of honour.
Lastly, in spite of the vast diversity of tolerated religions, some traces
of common religious ideas begin to develope themselves. The restora-
tion of religion had formed a great part of the policy of Augustus, and
his aspirations are devoutly seconded by the poets of his court ⁹. Besides
the rebuilding or restoration of almost every temple in the city ¹⁰, he had
endeavoured to bring home religion to the mass of the people by a kind
of parochial system, in the worship of the ‘ Lares compitales' at the 300
chapels ²² instituted in the various vici, under the ministration of their
freedmen priests (‘Augustales ’), and superintendenee of the ‘ vico· ¹
magistri 1²: With these the worship of his own ‘Genius’ was associated ¹⁸,
by which constant usage, as well as by the‘ludi compitalicii ²⁴,' the polit-

¹ It is implied in Acts 22. 2 that Greek given by Augustus not only to individuals
would have been intelligible, though less (e. g. 1. 58, 2), but to communities (Suet.
so than Hebrew, to most of the crowd Aug. 47); of which Utica is an instance.
