45. Sic compositis praesentibus haud minor moles supererat

1. secuti exemplum, sc. ‘legionum.’
The separation of the ‘veterani sub vex-
illo' from the legions is here clearly indi-
eated.

2. Raetiam. This name strictly an-
swers to the modern Grisons and Tyrol,
but often, as here, is taken to include the
frontier country of Vindelicia; which com-
prised southern Bavaria between the Inn
and the Upper Danube, and extended later
to the ¹ limes Romanus? See Introd. vii.
p. 93. Both countries were reduced to
subjection by Drusus and Tiberius in 739,
Rc. 15 (Liv. Epit. 138; Vell. 2. 39, 35
Hor. Od. 4. 4 and 14). Their only im-
portant town was ·Augusta Vindelicorum’
(Augsburg): see G. 41, 1.

3. Suebos. The various tribes group-
ed under this name extended in the time
of Tacitus from the Baltic to the Danube
(cp. G. 38-43), and many of them had
been formed into a powerful organization
by Maroboduus; on whom see note on 2.

osterum: cp. c. 10, 1.

. nutris. Nipp. takes this as dat. ;

. hut Vergil has the abl. ‘complexu avol-

sus Iuli’ (Aen. 4, 616).
4. trucibus, ‘gloomyz’ cp. ‘lucosque
vetusta relligione truces’ Claud. Laud.

¹ Stil. 1, 229.

5. centurionatum inde egit. The

· sense required is that of ‘ centuriones re-

censuit: or ‘creavit ; ’ the former process
plone being described, but the latter
unplied; as the vaoencies of those dis-
iamed or killed (c. 32, 3) had to be
filled up. But ‘ centurionatus‚’ which

ζ’ . (according to N ipp.)-is found only in val.

ὲ

Max. 3. 2, 23, and in an inscription of

. Antonine times (Ι. R. N. 2653), must
q mun ‘the office of centurion‘ (cp. ‘op- moles, ‘difficulty;’ as 2· 78, ¹» etc· ·
i L

tionatus,’ ‘ decurionatus,' etc.); and thus
the centurion himself should rather be
said ‘centurionatum agere? It is per-
haps possible, on the 'analogy of ‘ delec-
tum agere,’ to make the phrase mean “t-o.-
hold an election of centurions ; ‘ but more

pro a y e passage is corrupt. The

most plausible emendation, however,

‘centurionum reatum’ (Bernhardy, cited

by Baiter), introduces a word unknown

in Tacitus and very rare otherwise; and

one which hardly seems to bear the

meaning here required.

7. dona militaria, ‘decorations.' Such
are mentioned in 3. 21, 33 Juv. 16, 57-
60; and many inscriptions (See Henzen,
Index, p. 144). The brilliant appearance
osan army when these were worn, as in
full dress, is described in H. 2. 89, 3.

si . . . adprobaverunt, . . . ubi . . .
obiectavissent. ‘Si' and ‘ ubi’ afe
interchanged (both with indie.) in 4. 17,
1 3 ‘ si ' and ‘ut ' (both with subj.) in 11.
28, 3; and such changes are frequent:
see Drager‚ Synt. und Stil, 5 233. The
moods are interchanged, as here, in 6.
18, 5,where see note. Here there ap-
pears to be a compromise between the
subj. of repeated action, usual in writers
of this age, and the indic. of earlier
writerS. See Introd. v. ξ 52. Walther
takes it to imply that approval was the
rule and disapproval the exception.

9. avaritiam, in selling ‘vacatIOnes.'
See on c. 17, 6.

10. solvebatur militia. This is the
‘ignominiosa missi03' as distinct from ¹
the ‘honesta,' on completion of Servlce,
and ‘causaria,’ for disease. Macer, Dig.
49. 16, 13. ¹

11. praesentibus: cp. c. 3ο, 5.
