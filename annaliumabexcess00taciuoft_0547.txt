non sermone, non visu dignatus erat, quidam male alacres, quibus

magna pars plebis, probably the
better sort, who could afford the journey,
and had some hope of a rise in rank.
The attachment of the ‘ plebs sordida ’ to

takes it to mean that Seianus was more un-
. approachable than Tiberius ; but 'it seems
more probable that the contrast was with
his former habit (ep. c. 40, 7); he had
¹ grown harder of access, and only those
4 who made interest to get at him and
¹ shared his plans could see him. The
‘ambitus' would be exercised on the
‘ianitores’ etc. (§ 63. Nipp. understands
by ⁴ societate consiliorum: that men took
η ench other into council and helped each
, other to get audience3 but we should

perpetiebantur; the condescension
of such persons was as odious as their
insogence. On the court paid to them,
cp. . 8, 10.

9. id quoque: so all modern edd.
after Mur. for the MS. ‘idque' Ritter
notes (on c. τι) that in all cases where
‘ que’ has the force of ¹ quoque’ (as in 1.
65, 2; 2. 37, 1; 57, 1, etc.), it follows
the first word in a sentence.

10. male, ‘with bad reason 3 ¹ explained

14. She would appear to have been now
barely thirteen years old. From this
marriage L. Domitius, afterwards the
emperor Nero, was born nine years later,
and her husband died about three years
after that date (Suet. Ner. 6). Many
representations of her on coins exist (see
Cohen, i. pp. 271-276).

during this visit to Campania.

Domitio, Cn. Domitius Ahenobar-
bus, cos. 785, A. D. 32 (6. 1, 1). Sue-
tonius (Ner. 5) speaks os him as ‘omni
parte· vitae detestabilis! For further
mention of him in Tacitus, see 6. 45, 4;
47, 2;12. 3, 2;13.10‚ 1. He is also
osten mentioned as one of the ‘Arvales’
from 780 to 792, A.D. 27-39 (C. Ι. L. vi.
1, 2024-2029). Nipp. also refers to him
the inser. C. Ῑ. Att. iii. 1, 604. On
his father, and on the relationship to

Augustus, see c. 44, 2, 3.
