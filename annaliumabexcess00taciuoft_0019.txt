ΟΝ ΤΗΕ LIFE AND WORKS OF TACITU83 AND ΟΝ
ΤΗΕ FIRST MEDICEAN MS.

ΤΗΕ personal history of Tacitus is known to us only from allusions

to it in his own works, and from the letters of his friend, the younger
’ Pliny ς from which sources, scanty as they are, we yet learn something

more of his biography than is known of that of many other great
ν writers.

A few fixed dates help to determine others. He was betrothed in
marriage, during the consulship of his father-in-law, in 830, Aa). 77 ¹ ;
he was praetor at the ludi saeculares celebrated by Domitian, in ἔῃ,
Aa). 88 ². It is also stated that his ‘dignitas' or career of office began,
no doubt with the quaestorship‚ under Vespasian, and reached a second
step, prssimably that of a tribunate or aedileship‚ under Titus ³. He
must therefore have filled these offices respectively not later than in

ξ 832 and 834, aa). 79 and 81; and must have been at least twenty-five

years old at the earliest of these dates.
