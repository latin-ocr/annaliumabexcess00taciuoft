9. patre praetorio. He may probably
have been the L. Ateius L. f. An. Capito

mentioned in a senatus consultum in Cic.
ad Fam. 8. 8, 5. Another, with the prae-
nomen ‘Gaius,' was trib. pleb. in 699,
B.c. 55 (Dio, 39. 32, 3), and the same
name occurs in Cic. de Div. 1. 16, 29.

given, ⁴ C. Ateius L. f. L. n. Capito!

10. Labeonem Antistium, mentioned
by Gellius (13, 10, etc ), and constantly
in juridical writings. His father, who
killed himself aster Philippi (App. B. C.
4. 135), was also a jurist.

12. duo pacis decora. They are known
in the history of jurisprudence as the
founders of the two schools called, from
the names of subsequent leaders, Sabini-
ans and Proculians. The decisions of
Capito are described as strictly grounded
on, those of Labeo as more independent
of, tradition and precedent (Dig. 1. 2, 2,
ξ 47): see Gibbon, ch. 44.

incorrupta libertate, abl. of qual-
ity. His rival Capito, quoted by Gellius
(13, 12), says he had a ‘libertas nimia
atque vecors.² An illustration is given by
Dio (54. 15, 7) and Suetonius (Aug. 54);
that at the choice of senators in 736, Β. c.
18, ‘quum vir virum legeret,’ he chose
M. Lepidus the ex-triumvir, though an
enemy ofAugustus, and exiled from Rome,
glad defended his choice with spirit and

gnity·

13. obsequium: cp. c. 70, 2. The
story, that he said os a doubtful word
used by Tiberius, that if it was not Latin,
it would soon become so (Suet. de Gr.
22), is hardly to the point.
