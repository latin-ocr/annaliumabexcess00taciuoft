LIFE ANI) WORKS OF TACJTUS. 5

y The titles assigned to the two greater works require some remark.
In the second Medicean MS„ both ‘Annals' and ‘Histories,' without
any distinguishing title, are numbered continuously as the ‘Books of ·
Cornelius Tacitus! The latter, however, are called ‘Historiae’ by
Pliny ¹, and are definitely cited, as a separate work under that title,
by Tertullian ².

For the title ‘Annales’ there is no real authority.
indeed, in one place, speak of his work as ‘Annales nostri ³,' and,
in another, of his general purpose to relate events in their chrono-
logical order ⁴. But there is no evidence that he intended the title
distinctively for this work ; and he elsewhere uses ‘ annales ' as a general
term for ‘history ⁵.' It is with equal generality that Jornandes speaks
of him as ‘annalium scriptor ⁶! In the first Medicean MS. the books
are entitled ‘ab excessu Augusti: a title analogous to that of the t
Histories of Livy, ‘ ab urbe condita?

Of the manuscripts, it will be sufficient here to notice the first
Medicean, comprising only the books contained in this volume and
forming the sole authority for them ⁷.

Ruodolphus, a learned monk of Fulda in Hesse Cassel, writing in
the ninth century, cites Tacitus as speaking of the Visurgis, and would
therefore appear to have known a manuscript containing these books ⁸. ’
The next intimation is from Poggio Bracciolini‚ who writes in 1425
on a communication made to him from Germany, respecting some
unknown works of Tacitus said to be· preserved at Hersfeld, near
Fulda. Nothing further is known till 1509, by which time the MS.
now existing‚ purporting to be only the latter half of its original
bulk ⁹, appears to have been brought to Rome to Cardinal Giovanni
de’ Medici (afterwards Leo X), who a few years later entrusted
its publication to Beroaldus, in whose edition, published at Rome

⁷ The information here given is chiefly

derived from the Preface to Ritter’s edi-
tion of 1864 (Leipzig), partly also from
Orelli and Baiter. An account of the
second Medicean MS. will be found in
Introduction to vol. ii.

⁸ The first and second books of the
Annals contain the only mention of this
n'ver in the extant works of Tacitus.

⁹ The ‘ fasciculi: comprising 137 leaves
in all, are numbered xvii to xxxiiii. Ritter
(Praef. p. xv) thinks it probable that the
last part contained the minor works; but
it may have consisted of some other
author, as the second Medicean MS. .
comprises, besides Tacitus, portions of
Apuleius.
