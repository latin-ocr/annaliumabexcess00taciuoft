construction of a participle with ὡς is
very rare, and not founffwith the future
participle. Tacitus has ‘ ut . . . arguens '
(4. 33, 6); ‘ut . . . transmissurus' (H. 2.
58, 4l; ‘ut . . . positurus' (H. 3. 68, 4).
See other instances in Introd. v. ξ 67.

1 . legit . . . conquisivit.. . adornavit.

to ‘Vetera' soon after leading the two
other legions to the ‘civitas Ubiorum'
(c. 37, 3), as he is not mentioned in the
events there (c. 39—44).

7. praesumant: cp. 2. 73, 6; 3. 46,
2, etc. The word is confined to poets
and post-Augustan prose.

On the fondness of Tacitus for asyndeta 8. promisca.. The first Medicean MS.

in lively narrative, see Introd. v. ξ 65.
In such clauses he more frequently uses
the historical infinitive (as 2. 31, 1), or
issssienislssfiyHaff' tia} {L’gss‘ssingsshf tii}
clause, but sometimes sor variety at the
end in the last clause (as c. 68, 2 ; 2. 29,
ῐ). Other examples are here collected by
Ni .

{posui-zatus, ‘ le ‘ :' cp. 13. 44,
2, etc. ; freq. in poets and Livy.

3. vulgum. This accus„ found in
Lucr., Verg., and Liv. is not unfrequent
in Tacitus: cp. 3. 76, 23 4. 14, 4; 6. 44,
1 ; and several other references given by
Ni .

gp dandum . . . spatium. This is
equivalent to ‘ exspectandum ς’ with which
verb, or with such as express or imply
design‚ or attempt, ‘si' is osten used in
the sense of ‘ whether,' ρι- ‘in case that.'
See Madv. 451 d. Drager (Synt. und
Stil, ξ 193) notes the usage as found in
Cicero, and Caesar, and especially in
Livy, and that it is not really a Graecism.

6. exemplo, that of the two other
legions (c. 44).

Caecinam. He must have gone on

has always this form (cp. 3. 34. 3; 53, 53
70, 2 ; 4. 16, 5 ; 37, 5); whereas the
second interchanges it with ‘ promiscuus‘
(cp. e. g. 14. 14, 3 and 15. 9, 2). Halm
throughout adopts the formem Baiter ancl
others follow the MS. On such variationS,
see Introd. v. ξ 85, Pfitzner, p. 42.
aquiliferis signiferisque. On the

ἱ former cp. c. 39, 7: ⁸ signiferi legionum '

are often mentioned in inscriptions.
Orelli (on Inscr. 3482) supposes them to
be ‘ signiferi cohortium’ (see on c. 18, 3);
Ritter, to be the bearers of the ‘ vexilla’
or ‘signa' of maniples, for whom no
special title appears to occur in inscrip-
tions. Caecina appears to be obliged to
act through these officers, as there were
no centurions left. See c. 32, 3.

10. eximant. The dative with this
verb, frequent in poets and post-Augustau
prose, is generally used by Tacitus (cp.
c. 64,4; 2. 55, 3; 3. 18, 1, etc), except
in Agr. 3, 3, and perhaps in 14. 64, 1.

11. causas, ‘excusem' so ‘causam
seditioni' (H. 4. 19, 1); ‘ accipio causam'
(Cic. Fam. 16. 19). .
th} 5. priemptum. On the dative with

is wor , see c. 2, 1.
