lentium Caecinae tradit3

totidem legiones, duplicem sociorum

numerum ipse ducit, positoque castello super vestigia paterni
5 praesidii in monte Tauno expeditum exercitum in Chattos rapit,

L. Apronio ad munitiones viarum et fluminum relicto.

(rarum illi caelo) siccitate et amnibus modicis inoffensum iter
properaverat, imbresque et fluminum auctus regredienti metue-

bantur.

sed Chattis adeo inprovisus advenit, ut quod imbe-
10 cillum aetate ac sexu statim captum aut trucidatum sit.

iu-

ventus flumen Adranam nando tramiserat, Romanosque pontem

coeptantis arcebant.

frustra condicionibus pacis, cum quidam ad Germanicum per-

But the mention of Segimerus seems out
of place, and he was probably now dead
(see 2. 10, 1); so that it seems better to
take the words as genit. sing„ and explain
them by supposing that ‘invisus’ and
‘inimici' are to be distinguished; the
meaning being that Arminius, already at
enmity with Segestes on public grounds,
was additionally hateful to him from the
way in which he became his son-in-law.
This would be expanded in the next
sentence (⁶ quaeque . . . erant ’)‚ where
‘ apud insensos’ answers to ‘ inimici,' and
‘incitamenta irarum' to ‘invisus’ The
correction of Nipp. ‘inimicus soceri' is
tempting, both from the analogy of
‘invisus avunculo infensusque ' (H. 4. 70,
3), and from the likelihood of a loss of
the terminal ‘s‚’ owing to the initial of
the next word. The passages cited from
2. 45, 2, and 3. 16, 6, are hardly apposite.

1. Igitum this takes up the narrative
from‘ praecepit' (c. 55, 1)p

2. tumultuarias: cp.15. 3, 3. Livy
osten uses the word of troops levied for
m emergency. Such are also called‘ su-
bitus miles’ (H. 4. 76, 2), and ‘subitarii'
(Liv. 3. 4, 11).

3. Caecinae. The service for which
he was detached is shown below, where
t‘ne mention of the Marsi suggests that
his advance was in the same direction as
that of last year (c. 5ο, 51).

totidem legiones. The four le-
gions of the upper army (cp. c. 37, 4) are
under the special command of Germani-
cus throughout this campaign; hence their
legatus, Silius, is unmentioned. See e.
72, 1.

4. paterni praesidii. Taunus (cp
12. 28,1; Mela 3. 3, 30) is clearly the
high tract, still preserving the name, ex-
tending, nearly parallel with the Main,
from the Rhine to the Nidda between
Wiesbaden and Homburg. The fort
would therefore be that described· in Dio
(54 33, 4), as built by Drusus παρ’ αυτῷ
τῷ Ῥήνῳ.

5. rapit= ‘raptim ducit? so 4. 2 5 2,
etc.; Liv. 3. 23, 3; taken apparently from
Vergil (Aen. 7, 7253 10, 1783 308).

6. L. Apronio. This legatus, who
received ‘triumphalia’ this year (c. 72,
1), appears from the Fasti (C. Ι. L. 1. p.
548) to have been cos. suff. in 761, Α. D.
8. He is generall identified with the
Apronius who ha served in Delmatia
(Vell. 2. 116, 2); and with the proconsul
ofAfrica in 773, A. D. 20 (3 21, 1); prob-
ably also with the leg atus of Lower Ger-
manyin 781, A..D 28g(4.73,1; 6. 30, 3).

7. rarum: cp. the similar parenthesis,
0· 39 7·

inoffensum,
ical, and in prose from L. Seneca: the
transitive‘ properare’ is found in Sallust,
but' ls also chiefly poetieal.

8. metuebantur. Lipsius has been
generally followed in this correction of
the MS. ‘metuebatur3' as ‘auctus’ is
probably plural, as well as ‘imbres'

11. Adranam, the Eder, which takes,
a north· easterly course, and, alittle above
Cassel, joins the Fulda, itself a tributary
of the W eser.

14. pagis vicisque: these words are‘
thus joined in G. 12, 3. The former is
used of some definite cantonal subdivision ¹
