text as above.

1. Ephesii Milesiique: see 3. 61, 1:
63, 5. The temple of Caesar was not to
be placed in a city where any other and
more popular worship would eclipse it.

2. caerimonia, ‘the rites' or ‘wor-
ship:’ so more commonly in plur. as
‘incuria caerimoniarum . . . Augusti' c.
36, 2. For a different use of the singular,
see 3. 61, 3, etc.

3. Sardianos. It isv to be inferred
that they had recovered from the disaster
caused by the earthquake (2. 47, 3).

Zmyrnaeos: see 3. 63, 4.

league of the twelve cities (Liv. 5. 1,

quest οἱ Etruria.

4. Tyrrhenum Lydumque. Th'isle·

with some differences, in Dion. Hal. 1,
27; Strab. 5. 2, 2, 4, 219, 222.

5. Atye, according to Hdt. (1.1.) son
of Manes; Strabo (l. 1.) givesanother form
of the pedigree, and also mentions a ver-
sion making him son of Heracles and
Omphale.

in Graeciam. It has been thought
that Tacitus would have more correctly
specified the part of Greece, and may
have written ‘in insulam,' for which ‘in
Graeciam ’ was perhaps originally a mar-
ginal gloss.
