al CHARA CTER AND GOVERNMENT OF TIBERIUS. 113

 

his mother became the wife of the triumvir3 only nine¹ when his father’s

death transferred him to the tutelage of his stepfather, who two years

later became the undisputed master of the Roman empire. From this

ἶ ’ point, his life, in the judgment of popular exaggeration, seemed enviable
in the extreme. He is ‘brought up from infancy in a reigning family,
loaded with consulships and triumphs in his youth 2! To a more careful
observer, the thirty-five years next ensuing are a history of harassing
intrigues and rivalries³ and souring disappointments, hardly compensated
by ultimate success.

He assumed the ‘toga virilis ’ in 727, B.c. 27, and by special privilege
became quaestor in his nineteenth year, in 731, B.c. 2 3⁴3 at which time

ι the death of young Marcellus, who was about a year older, removed
the first of his various rivals from his path ⁵. He was praetor in 7 37,

, Μ). 17, at the age of twenty-five, and consul in 741, 13.c. 13, at the age

of twenty-nine ⁶.

Side by side with his advancement in civil offices came a succession
of military commands. After a ‘ tirocinium' as military tribune in the
Cantabrian war, he was sent in 734, 13.e. 20, in his twenty-second year,
with forces to the East‚ to give a king to Armenia 3 and had the honour

⁸ of bringing back the standards lost ¹with Crassus ⁷. In 739, B.c. 15, he
shared with his brother Drusus the* more arduous task of subduing the
>mountaineers of the Grisons and Tyrol ⁸3 a service which probably gave

’ the youths their ‘ nomen imperatorium ⁹.’ About this time he received in
< , marriage Vipsania Agrippina, daughter, by a former wife ¹⁰, of Agrippa,
who now stood next to Augustus as his son-in-law11 and his colleague in
the tribunitian power ¹².

Whatever hopes may have been raised by the unexpected death of
Agrippa, in 742, nc. 12, at the age of fifty-one—which left only two
⁴ boyS, aged eight and five ¹³, between the stepsons and the succession—

'vould fade gradually as time went on and the lads grew older ; while the

immediate disastrous consequence to Tiberius was the shadow cast over
his domestic life, by his forced divorce from Vipsania, to whom he was
³ deeply attached ¹⁴ and his marriage, for mere dy nastic reasons, to Julia,

who may have courted him as a lover, but despised him as her husband,
³2 and showed her contempt by her outrageous profligacy¹⁵. Almost.
